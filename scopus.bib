	abstract = {The objectives of the National Action Charter of Bahrain include improving the quality of life, encouraging investment in the green economy, providing job opportunities, developing skills, promoting environmental management, protecting the environment and biodiversity, developing civil society, and encouraging women's participation in economic and political life. The National Action Charter has achieved great success in achieving the goals of sustainable development in Bahrain, as it contributed to improving the quality of life, providing job opportunities, protecting the environment, and raising awareness of the importance of sustainable development. In order to sustain this success, the National Action Charter requires a commitment to promoting economic diversification, improving environmental management, supporting civil society, and encouraging women's participation in economic and political life. Despite Bahrain's challenges, it is committed to achieving sustainable development goals and strengthening its position as a model for sustainable development in the world. The study also raises a major question, which is what is the role of the Bahrain National Charter in achieving the goals of sustainable development? In order to answer the study question and test the hypothesis, the researchers will review previous studies in the field of sustainable development, and study the basic concepts of sustainable development and its role in comprehensive development. As well as studying the history and work of the Bahraini National Charter and how to apply it on the ground, and analyzing the challenges Bahrain faces in achieving sustainable development and how to overcome them. In addition to studying the sustainability practices adopted in Bahrain. : It was proven to us that the hypothesis from which the study was based was correct, which was based on the fact that the Bahraini National Charter includes a number of procedures and policies that aim to achieve sustainable development in Bahrain. It has become clear to us that the National Charter plays a vital role in directing efforts towards achieving the goals of sustainable development, and it is one of the main tools used by Bahrain in achieving these goals, by encouraging innovation and green technology, the transition to a low-carbon economy, and improving the quality of air, water and soil. Protecting the environment and promoting biodiversity. The Bahrain National Charter also works to promote the sustainability of economic growth, the environment and society. In order for this success to continue, the Bahraini National Charter requires commitment to promoting economic diversification, improving environmental management, supporting civil society, and encouraging women's participation in economic and political life.

	abstract = {This research examines the impact of firms’ decision-making, crisis management, and risk-taking behaviors on their sustainability and circular economy behaviors through the mediating role of their eco-innovation behavior in the energy industry in Iraq. Firms are exploring applicable mechanisms to increase green practices. This requires the industry to possess the essential skills to overcome the challenges that reduce sustainable activities. We applied a dual-stage structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to explore the linear relationships between variables, determine the weight of the criteria, and rank energy companies based on a circular economy. The online questionnaire was sent to 549 managers and heads of departments of Iraqi electric power companies. Out of these, 384 questionnaires were collected. The results indicate that firms’ crisis management, decision-making, and risk-taking behaviors are significantly and positively linked to their eco-innovation behavior. This study confirms the significant and positive impact of firms’ eco-innovation behavior on their sustainability and circular economy behaviors. Likewise, eco-innovation behavior has a fully mediating role. For the MCDM methods, ranking energy companies according to the circular economy can support policymakers’ decisions to renew contracts with leading companies in the ranking. Practitioners can also impose government regulations on low-ranked companies. Thus, governments can reduce the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Hard-metal sector, strategic for the industrial economies, is suffering from the reduced availability and price volatility of its main feedstock: critical W and Co. In 2021, a 73.5 kt W and 9.2 kt Co demand for hard-metal production (65% and 5.3% of global demand, respectively), was recorded. Hard-metal scrap recycling is hence desirable for both environmental and economic reasons. A significant recovery of W and Co from manufacturing by-products and scraps is already good practice in the hard-metal industry (42% for W and 22% for Co). However, there is still a lot to do to meet the technical-economic-environmental sustainability in materials and energy enhancement for pursuing a green economy model. Indeed, Chemical Modification and Direct Recycling, which are the most widely employed industrial approaches, typically involve energy and/or harsh chemicals-intensive treatments which require expensive equipment and skilled workers. In the last decade, research efforts have been spent on implementing alternative materials reclamation processes from hard-metal scraps based on the use of bio-based organic acids with the view to increase the rate and quality of the recycled materials exploiting their peculiar metal complexing action as well as to preserve natural resources and prevent the disposal of potentially toxic/polluting substances. Despite the preliminary stage of the research, organic acids were demonstrated to be powerful but gentle agents for the selective leaching of cobalt from WC-Co-based materials as well as promising agents for WO3 dissolution. Indeed, thanks to their acid and complexing properties, they can stabilize metals in their oxidized form giving soluble products and preventing passivation phenomena. Furthermore, organic acids can be obtained by renewable biomass transformation, limiting the request for high-impact industrial chemicals. Hence they points out key features making them promising for the design of eco-friendly recovery processes. In this context, the different industrial approaches to the recovery and recycling of Hard-metal wastes, with specific reference to the role of bio-derived organic acids in hydro- and solvo-metallurgical processes, will be critically reviewed with the view of opening a discussion on the perspectives of their use in designing circular economy models in HM manufacturing as economically, technically and environmentally sustainable as possible. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes a framework of drivers and barriers to NIEs for SDGs implementation used in the Latvian context. An exploratory qualitative approach based on the Latvian case study is used to generate in-depth information on the drivers and barriers of NIEs for implementing SDGs. Our results show that at the NIE level, drivers for actors and institutions, such as legislative compliance, eco-innovations, cross-sector cooperation, and talent pools, are hindered by some barriers, such as lack of networking skills, institutional voids, totalitarian power, and academic rigidity. Despite attempts at technological convergence that facilitated distance learning, remote work, and telehealth solutions during the pandemic, the lack of collaborative platforms hinders the development of artifacts. Sustainable innovation is hindered by a lack of resources and openness that also blocks open innovation. Beyond coevolution and co-specialization initiatives, friction between the public and private sectors hinders complementary and substitute relations. Our results provide a systemic and holistic NIE tool to analyze the drivers and barriers of the SDGs. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

Selecting industrial wastewater discharge, industrial SO2 emissions and industrial soot emissions as the evaluation indicators of environmental pollution, this paper uses the panel data model and mediation effect model to empirically examine the impact of industrial robots on environmental pollution and its mechanisms. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Industrial robots can significantly reduce environmental pollution. (2) Industrial robots can reduce environmental pollution by improving the level of green technology innovation and optimizing the structure of employment skills. (3) With the increase in emissions of industrial wastewater, industrial SO2, and industrial dust, the impacts generated by industrial robots are exhibiting trends of a “W” shape, gradual intensification, and progressive weakening. (4) Regarding regional heterogeneity, industrial robots in the eastern region have the greatest negative impact on environmental pollution, followed by the central region, and the western region has the least negative impact on environmental pollution. Regarding time heterogeneity, the emission reduction effect of industrial robots after 2013 is greater than that before 2013. Based on the above conclusions, this paper suggests that the Chinese government and enterprises should increase investment in the robot industry.

	abstract = {The green energy revolution may displace 1.7 million fossil fuel workers in the US but a Just Transition to emerging green industry jobs offers possibilities for re-employing these workers. Here, using 14 years of power plant data from the US Energy Information Administration, job transition data from the Census Bureau, as well as employment and skills data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we assess whether people employed in fossil fuel resource extraction today are co-located and have the transferable skills to switch to expected green jobs. We find that these workers could leverage their mobility to other industries and have similar skills to green occupations. However, today’s fossil fuel extraction workers are not co-located with current sources of green energy production. Further, after accounting for federal employment projections, fossil fuel extraction workers are mostly not located in the regions where green employment will grow despite attaining the appropriate skillsets. These results suggest a large barrier to a Just Transition since fossil fuel extraction workers have not historically exhibited geospatial mobility. While stakeholders focus on re-skilling fossil fuel extraction workers, this analysis shows that co-location with emerging green employment will be the larger barrier to a Just Transition. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to test and analyze empirically the role of Digital Human Resource Management (DHRM) on Supply Chain Performance (OP) mediated by Green Orientation (GO) and Green Innovation (GI). Design/methodology/approach: This study involved supply chain managers in manufacturing companies in DKI Jakarta and West Java Provinces, Indonesia. The reason is that these two provinces had many manufacturing companies and were two of the largest industrial cities in Southeast Asia. Based on the survey conducted, there were 160 questionnaires distributed. However, the data that meets the requirements is 145 and can be processed further. This study used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis technique using Partial Least Square. Findings: This study has confirmed a number of findings including: (1) Digital HRM had a positive and significant influence on SC performance, (2) Digital HRM had a positive and significant influence on green orientation, (3) Green Orientation had no positive and significant influence on SC performance, (4) Green Orientation did not mediate the effect of Digital HRM on SC performance, (5) Green Innovation had a positive and significant influence on green orientation and Green Innovation did not moderate the influence of digital HRM on SC performance. Research limitation/implications: This study only focuses on the scope of Digital Human Resource Management (DHRM) on Supply Chain Performance (SCP). The mediating role of Green Orientation and the moderating role of Green Innovation in research findings did not have a significant contribution. The next study is expected to examine the concept of digital HRM which is not only oriented towards green orientation and green innovation in manufacturing companies. Other considerations are needed such as digital entrepreneurship, digital business and digital skills which are currently developing in the world and even in Indonesia. This is because Digital entrepreneurship, digital business and digital skills are one of the supporters of economic growth and company performance in a sustainable manner. Managerial implication: This study is expected to be a reference for practitioners, especially in the field of Digital Human Resource Management (DHRM) on Supply Chain Performance (SCP). Furthermore, the concept of digital HRM by organizations can be used as an effective alternative in continuously improving SC performance in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Theoretical implication: The findings of this research provide a theoretical contribution related to the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance, although green orientation did not mediate the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance, likewise, green innovation did not mediate the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance. However, these two aspects can be an important focus in this research and must be considered for further research. Originality/value: This study has originality because it examines the role of digital HRM on SC performance which is still very rarely researched especially when it is associated with the mediating role of green orientation and green innovation. © 2023, OmniaScience.

	abstract = {This commentary responds to Chantel Carr's ‘Repair and care’ through a focus on the vexed question of carbon-intensive worker retraining in the context of urgent and necessary decarbonisation and industry change in Australia. There are many parallels between my research and Carr's, particularly in relation to an understanding of the potential of existing technical skillsets in industrial working populations. Like Carr, I reflect upon my empirical research – over the past decade – with current and former industrial tradespeople. This commentary reflects on what ‘retraining’ has actually meant, in practice, for industrial workers in deindustrialising Australia. I then identify a key tension that exists in relation to the question of retraining carbon workers. Climate change mitigation calls for the dramatic and wide-ranging transformation of industries, infrastructure, jobs, and skillsets. But the fact remains, humans are complex, with diverse needs, and they are now more likely to articulate these needs on an individual level, not collectively. With this in mind – and in a background in which much academic work draws attention to complexities and institutional shortcomings – how do we balance individualised requirements with the need for dramatic, macro-level transformation? © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Drawing upon the natural resource-based view (NRBV), green absorptive capacity (GAC) is the backbone of firm green dynamic capabilities. It converts the developed knowledge into knowledge application. Understanding how GAC could benefit corporation environmental performance (EP) is still ambiguous and debated. Hence, this study introduced three facilitator factors, namely, managerial environmental concern (MEC), green innovation performance (GIP) and green entrepreneurship orientation (GEO), in which GAC can improve EP. The study tested the moderation effect of GAC and GEO on the MEC-GEO and the MEC-EP relationships and predicted the mediation effect of MEC, GEO and GIP on the GAC-EP relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative study used a self-administered survey and cross-sectional research design; the study collected data from top management employees working in Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings: The results indicated that GAC positively influences MEC, GEO and GIP, and these last three constructs influence EP. While MEC positively affects GIP, the MEC-GEO relationship was insignificant. The study found that GAC moderates the MEC-GEO relationship, whereas GEO failed to do so between MEC and EP. The results confirm a partial mediation effect between GAC-EP through the three intermediary constructs. Practical implications: To promote EP, firms GAC should prioritize developing MEC ad GIP. Firms' GEO can exploit eco-friendly opportunities enabled by GAC, a process that bridges the existing knowledge and skills gap between MEC and GEO. GAC is one of the leading green strategic capabilities that help GEO to achieve green business growth and better EP. MEC is the process of facilitating GIP to deliver eco-products and protect the external environment. When MEC failed to address GEO's green business agenda, GEO could not enhance EP. Originality/value: The study highlights the necessity of GAC to develop firms' green dynamic capabilities to boost EP. The study confirms GAC's vital role in strengthening the manager's environmental awareness and bridging the knowledge gap between GEO and MEC. In addition, GIP can drive entrepreneurial green opportunities and enhance EP when GAC is involved and converts knowledge creation to knowledge applications. Strategically speaking, given the importance of the triple green pillars of the NRBV, GEO would not balance green business growth and EP unless GAC leveled up MEC to match GEO's green business agenda and drive EP. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The importance of improving brain and mental health and developing sustainable environments is increasingly recognised. Understanding the syndemic interactions between these processes can help address contemporary societal challenges and foster global innovation. Here, we propose a green brain capital model that integrates environmental drivers of brain health and green skills necessary for long-term sustainability and discuss the role of interdisciplinary approaches in promoting individual and collective behavioural changes. We draw on existing literature and research to highlight the connections between brain health, environmental factors and green skills. Environmental factors and exposome can have long-lasting adverse effects on brain health, particularly in vulnerable populations. Investing in green brain capital can prepare societies to address global crises. Green skills, including creativity, ecological intelligence and digital literacy, are critical for promoting sustainable environments. Access to nature improves brain and mental health, and interdisciplinary fields such as neurourbanism can inform urban planning to benefit citizens' well-being. Building brain capital and environmental sustainability interactions requires increasing future generations' awareness, education and training. A comprehensive approach to green brain capital can enable greater societal scaling, synergistically protecting brain health and environmental sustainability. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Whilst there is a growing body of evidence relating to the environmental capabilities, eco innovation, sustainable supply chains and green skills of individual SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), much less attention has been paid to networked approaches to pro-environmental and sustainable SME support. The empirical studies that do exist mostly take a firm-centric approach. This study takes a network centric view to describe hitherto under-explored features of network functionality based on case analysis of a single business support network in the East Midlands of the UK. The resulting conceptual framework offers an analytical tool that can be used to study network functionality in the service of pro-environmental SME development more widely. Empirical data for this case analysis of a regional ‘low carbon’ business network is drawn from interviews with 25 stakeholders, analysis of programme level data and documentation, ‘insider’ observation of network activity and evidence from both independent and internal evaluations. The study charts key aspects of network provision and its impact upon SMEs and wider stakeholders. The paper then presents a conceptual model of pro-environmental business networking that identifies key internal features of network activity as well as various external drivers of multi-stakeholder engagement in the shift to a more sustainable local economy. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Public and private stakeholders increasingly rely on digital technologies to foster entrepreneurial ecosystems while pursuing the goal of sustainable competitiveness, which entails ensuring economic, environmental, and social development. Recently, the emergence of the twin transitions concept portraying an incontestable complementarity between digital and green transitions has led to calls for further research. Few studies have however investigated the antecedents of nations’ sustainable competitiveness. The present study fills this gap in the literature and quantitatively evaluates the effect of digitalization on entrepreneurial activity and sustainable competitiveness. It uses annual secondary data for an unbalanced panel of 34 countries from 2015 to 2018. Incorporating digitalization as a major disruptive factor that shapes our current lives, the results show that it positively affects entrepreneurial activity and sustainable competitiveness and that entrepreneurial activities drive sustainable competitiveness. The facets of digitalization influence sustainable competitiveness to various degrees; where connectivity, Internet use, and digital integration appear to be the main components affecting it. Whereas digital skills and digital public services are less significant. The results offer theoretical and practical implications for governments and policymakers, who are encouraged to nurture the creation of new ventures, ensure widespread and reliable connectivity, increase Internet use, and push for greater digital integration. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {While individual SMEs may have a minor environmental footprint, their collective influence is characterized as significant. Through the dynamics of their employees, green human resource management can help SMEs reduce their environmental footprint. However, SMEs face difficulties in implementing such strategies and achieving sustainable business continuity. The current research aims to propose the theoretical framework of a business model that will help SMEs adjust to the new environment, address their sustainable goals and gaps in the field, and build a resilient, agile business ecosystem. To approach the research issue, we used the R-based Bibliometrix tool. Using the Scopus database, 368 papers were selected and analyzed as part of the study’s five steps. Bibliometric tools such as Biblioshiny, VOSviewer, and R Studio have been used to illustrate the findings. The study’s findings highlight a few different factors that will serve as the foundation for the proposed model. Green competencies, both natural and acquired, as well as the requirement to provide green motivation, are identified as critical for the development of the new business model. Furthermore, the combination of this set of factors contributes to the achievement of green organizational citizenship behavior, which is one of the most important factors in helping SMEs adopt green human resource management methods. Finally, all the above factors are under the wing of the principles of environmental management, which drive businesses to enhance and boost their environmental performance. © 2023 by the authors.},

Interestingly, the themes are in tandem with the Tourism Education Futures Institute (TEFI) value framework for nurturing sustainability practices in the hospitality industry through systematic programming of hotel management education. Practical implications: In order to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2030 (Goal 4) of ensuring lifelong strategic education to foster sustainability, the green skill–knowledge gap must be bridged at the academic level. The current paper sheds light on how the synergy between industry and academia can address this knowledge–skill gap and develop sustainable capacities in the long run.

However, currently, these two requests for sustainability and innovation often appear to be treated as two separate procurement targets. This paper provides a framework of specific purchasing and supply management (PSM) competencies needed to stimulate green innovation. Based on job ad analysis, we contribute to the literature by opening the black boxes “innovation purchaser” and “sustainability purchaser” and identifying about a dozen specific skills needed. Findings indicate that, as of now, job descriptions in job ads for sustainability and for innovation managers are almost antagonistic. In this way achieving green innovation in the supply chain is hampered. As a solution, this paper provides initial insights into merging the two roles into a “sustainability innovation purchaser”. It thus enables procurement to operationalise the Porter hypothesis (implementing a simultaneously cost-efficient and environmentally friendly supply chain). © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether women’s attitudes toward environmental innovation are impacted by their individual differences in skills, expertise, experience, and technical knowledge, as well as their visibility and legitimacy on boards. Using the categorization of directors developed by Hillman et al (J Manag Stud 37(2):235–256, 2000) and a dataset including the largest non-financial Spanish-listed entities reported on the IBEX-35 between 2015 and 2019, we can confirm the influence of female business expert and support specialist directors on environmental innovation. We find that although female business expert directors seem to positively influence environmental innovation even below a critical mass, female support specialist directors are only significant and positive drivers of eco-initiation when they gain power and authority on the board. This study confirms the need to examine the connection between women directors and eco-innovation based not only on their expertise and experience but also on their position and legitimacy on the board. In this regard, our results provide evidence that female support specialists need to have a large enough representation on boards to be effective in developing green initiatives. Our results are robust to alternative measures of green innovation (i.e., environmental performance) and overcome endogeneity concerns. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The potentially serious economic consequences of China’s severe air pollution problem cannot be overlooked, especially the impact on corporate innovation, which is a core driver guiding firms towards efficient and high-quality development. However, the existing literature has more often investigated the effect of pollution on corporate innovation from the perspective of environmental regulation, while relatively little research is available directly from the perspective of air pollution. In this study, for better causal identification and endogeneity treatment, we consider the Qin ling Mountains-Huai River heating policy as a quasi-natural experiment and explore for the first time the causal effect of air pollution on Chinese industrial firms’ innovation through a geographical regression discontinuity (RD) approach. The results find that air pollution has a significant inhibitory effect on the industrial firms’ innovation, especially for green innovation, where the innovation of state-owned enterprises, high pollution, and low monopoly firms are more sensitive to pollution. Specifically, a 1% increase in PM2.5 emissions leads to a 0.803% reduction in the corporate total innovation, a 0.924% reduction in invention patents, a 0.574% reduction in utility model patents, and a 1.087% reduction in design patents. We have verified the robustness of this core finding through a series of robustness checks including adjustment bandwidth, IV estimation, and placebo test. Further to this, we find that air pollution may negatively affect corporate innovation through three channels: crowding out R&D investment, reducing total factor productivity (TFP), and reducing labor supply and the proportion of highly skilled employees. This study sheds light on the severe losses caused by air pollution on corporate innovation capabilities at the micro-level, deepening the understanding of the economic harm caused by air pollution. This suggests that as firms strive to improve their innovative capacity and competitiveness, they should also be aware of environmental protection and green development; otherwise, unnecessary losses in innovation dynamics will be incurred.

	abstract = {With evidence of global climate change and ongoing ecological degradation, there is an urgent need to give more attention to sustainability within VET to ensure that VET does not remain complicit in reproducing the unjust and unsustainable trajectories of current economic and development pathways. At present, the VET literature does not adequately address these issues, hence the need for this special issue. In response, this paper offers a meta-reflective ‘landscape view’ of the sustainability within the VET ‘field of knowledge’ as it is emerging. Here, we use landscape review as a multi-dimensional, ‘outside-in’ view that provides a basis for understanding the broad context and helps to inform actionable next steps. This analysis we believe helps to highlight the key emerging priorities as well as what paths VET is taking on the journey to sustainability. The analysis shows that while some progress has been made in policy and practice related to the ‘greening’ of VET, much of the current response within VET to the environmental challenge reflects a minimalist reformist approach, characterised by ‘bolt-ons’ to existing institutional structures and curricula whilst leaving the fundamental beliefs in productivism, industrialisation and growth in place. Yet, as argued by researchers working on green economy, these beliefs are often complicit in co-creation of the environmental crisis. © 2024 The Author(s).

Namely, the study aims to examine the importance of organization members' (managers' and employees') GC for advancing a firm's OS. The theoretical grounding is exemplified by the empirical study based on individual interviews with managers. Study results explain how managers understand GC and how they see GC's role in enhancing companies' OS, as well as what are crucial barriers encountered in this process. The results show that GC, from a managerial perspective, are seen through the lens of people's pro-environmental awareness and knowledge followed by behaviors related to environmental protection. They indicate the economic, environmental, and social benefits of GC development, required for a firm's competitive advantage. The research contributes to the studies on GC being a significant antecedent of achieving the desired business results in terms of OS. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Energy produced by photovoltaic module (PVM) is poised to deliver the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) by 2030 and Net-Zero by 2050 but not until ample graduates with adequate Solar Energy Technology (SET) skills are produced by Higher education institutions (HEIs). Although PVM has witnessed significant penetration globally, the sustainability of the growth of the sector is challenged by attendant monotonic skilled labour shortages. The evolving growth imbalance is critical in the European Union (EU), limits her global competitiveness and necessitates the need to create wider awareness on the green technology to stimulate more production of solar energy sector (SES) specific skills graduates. Discussing the mismatch between the skills Europe needs and has in the SES, the study outlines key critical skills Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) cum Arts (STEAM) graduates ought to possess to secure sector employment and the challenges limiting them from acquiring the competencies. The review is conducted via extensive study of relevant literature, analysis of interviews and observations. Academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial skills are identified as critical SES needs. Designing and running educational modules/curricula that embed the identified solar technology specialist skills on students and learners are proposed as vehicle to increase their employability and entrepreneurship. This study profiles trends and developments in the SES for stakeholders’ increased awareness while presenting the specialist skills in-demand for employment in the sector. The adoption of SET Training (SETechTra) curricula/modules by the EIs will substantially increase the production of industry-ready graduates whilst decreasing the SES skills gap. © 2023 The Authors},

Theoretically, the paper discusses how collaborating with stakeholders with diverse motives and interests affects the development of diverse types of innovations; and whether and how a focal organisation's access to diverse information sources may influence the behaviour of different types of collaborators. The empirical analysis is based on Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (2015–2016) data. The results show that collaborations with secondary (primary) stakeholders are typically associated with the likelihood of developing eco-innovations (product and process innovations) and increased demand for skilled workers. We also find that access to diverse information sources is associated with the likelihood of collaborating with primary stakeholders only. © 2023 The Authors},

The contribution of this research is threefold: first, a theoretical framework to design learning activities targeting environmental awareness is presented; second, an IoT system (Spike) specifically designed to monitor plants in learning spaces is described and evaluated; third, alternative learning activities and paths for learning using plants and IoT technology are described from a teachers’ and students’ perspective.

	abstract = {China's economic growth has reached a new plateau. It is no longer appropriate to use the old economic growth model, which relied on labor, land resources, mineral resources, and other economic considerations. Under the background of artificial intelligence, high-quality economic development is an inevitable trend. A new financial paradigm called "digital finance" integrates financial services with information technologies. Digital financial technology is thought to be a crucial foundation for fostering high-quality and sustainable economic and social development since it may offer more economic entities reduced cost of capital and more realistic financial service skills than in traditional financial models. In the era of artificial intelligence, how to reasonably release the momentum of digital finance for China's sustained economic growth has become a hot topic of discussion at this stage. This paper studies the impact of digital finance on the economic efficiency of the energy industry in the context of artificial intelligence. Relevant metrics were also calculated. The findings revealed that: The benchmark regression result of digital finance on the efficiency of the green economy was 0.4685 before adding the main restrictions; the benchmark regression result of digital finance on the efficiency of the green economy was 0.2243 after adding the main constraints. As a result, data finance had a favorable impact on the effectiveness of the green economy. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

Because of this, we are investigating the effects of implementing business sustainability capabilities using a multiple-case methodology. An original report on China's small- and medium-sized businesses provided the data for this study that examined the theoretical and empirical relationships between financial literacy, innovation and environmental conservation. We devised a conceptual model to demonstrate the impact of corporate sustainability skills and competencies on climate change. Endogeneity concerns connected to financial literacy, innovation and ecological sustainability necessitate the employment of an instrumental variable for climate change. After adjusting for individual and firm characteristics, we found that financial literacy may substantially impact a company's sustainable business model. The findings suggest that financial literacy may boost company innovations by relieving financial restrictions and enhancing corporate governance, both of which contribute to the development of sustainable businesses that assist in increasing climate change mitigation efforts. On the other hand, innovation has a more significant influence on low-leverage companies. There was also a lot of talk about climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in the business context. This research, therefore, sheds light on how business sustainability capabilities and competencies might improve a company's environmental performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Achieving a just transition to a low carbon economy and society, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, is arguably one of the greatest policy challenges facing governments. It is also of deep concern to businesses, employees and the organisations that represent them. Much of the focus, particularly at policy level, has been on the potential of this transition to create new jobs especially through the growth of renewable energy and clean technology. In this paper, we argue that this focus on ‘green jobs', and in particular new green jobs, grossly underestimates the skills needs of a future workforce able to deliver a transition to a more sustainable low-carbon economy. The focus of this study is to gain an understanding of what skills are required to support the transition beyond these sectors. It critically reports on the results of a series of in-depth interviews with senior managers in key organisations within Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK. It sheds a light on the significant employment transitions taking place in organisations who are not specifically focused on delivering ‘green’ products or services. It finds widespread acknowledgement of the importance of a green recovery, albeit predicated by economic growth. The key skills needs reported, at all levels were likely to be ‘soft’ transferrable skills rather than ‘hard’ technical skills. COVID-19 was recognised as both a disrupter and as a catalyst for a green transition. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between bankers’ perspectives and their pro-green banking behaviors (i.e. intentions). Specifically, how do bankers’ perspectives on environmental concerns, environmental normative structure and green technology affect their intentions toward G-banking activities? Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework of the theory of bounded rational planned behavior (TBRPB) as its foundation was established. Using measurement scales to measure different aspects of environmental concern, environmental normative structure, green technology, attitudes, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms, a survey instrument was developed to examine the various associations implied by the model of TBRPB. Data were collected from the bankers of selected commercial banks in Bangladesh following the random sampling procedure. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling technique. Findings: Findings indicate that all of the predictors appear to be robust in predicting the G-banking intention of the sampled bankers in Bangladesh. The results also show that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have significant mediating effects toward bankers’ bounded rational G-banking intention. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in the study. First, the study considers environmental concerns as an antecedent of the attitude of bankers toward G-banking activities. Future studies can explore other variables related to environmental problems to study G-banking adoption and practices. Second, this study only considers the private conventional bankers as respondents to the survey to assess G-baking intention. In the future, other types of bankers, such as Islamic bankers and public banks’ bankers could be included in the survey to explore G-banking practices. Finally, this research has been done in a developing country-context. Practical implications: In this study, environmental concerns of bankers appeared to be highly significant predictors to influence their attitudes toward bounded rational G-banking intention. Similarly, the social normative structure also appears to be a robust antecedent of subjective norms to influence bounded rational G-banking intention of respondent bankers. Finally, green technology or bakers’ personal and skill-related ability to control bounded rational G-banking intention also appeared to be a strongly significant predictor of green banking activities. All this evidence implies that respondent bankers in the sample responded positively to provide their positive intention toward G-banking activities based on their environmental concern. Social implications: Important social implication of the current study is G-banking practices can help reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants which would enrich overall environmental sustainability and ecological conditions. Originality/value: Few studies are directed on G-banking perspective in Bangladesh. This research is one of the empirical studies which will certainly add values for the clients, institutions and policymakers in banking paradigm. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study investigates the challenges of implementing green building in four provinces of South Africa to categorise the key challenges. Drawing from a literature review and a quantitative inquiry approach, primary data were collected from 106 construction professionals with green building experience. This was complemented by descriptive and inferential statistics, namely exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The descriptive analysis using the mean score (MS) ranking technique revealed that higher up-front costs for green building and costs associated with green technologies and materials, and certification for green buildings were identified as key challenges to implementing green building projects. Furthermore, the EFA based on Monte Carlo parallel analysis revealed that the underlying grouped factors for the challenges were: ‘data and motivation management system’; ‘regulatory and steering factors’; ‘inadequate skilled professionals’; ‘behavioural barriers’ and ‘the cost of green building’. The results provide a valuable reference for construction professionals to institute a mechanism for evaluating performance periodically to identify challenges relating to green building projects. It is proposed that early identification of challenges and taking proactive steps to rectify problems is essential for green building to gain a competitive advantage over the traditional construction methods and may subsequently help ensure continual survival in the industry. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Understanding how environmental restrictions affect the relationship between economic stability and unbalanced technical innovation is crucial for optimizing environmental and financial policy frameworks in developing nations to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). Understanding the driving effect of green funding on green development is vital for promoting economic transformation and achieving long-term green growth. Green growth is one of the most exciting new strategies for sustained economic expansion. Despite environmental technology’s significance, further study is required to ascertain whether and how environmental technologies affect green development. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine how environmental technology may promote green growth in the G7 by reducing reliance on renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Investing in higher education is the most powerful thing a society can do intellectually if it is serious about attaining sustainability by applying skills, providing consulting, delivering training, and disseminating knowledge. Thus, the paper analyzes how the G7 countries’ pursuit of green economic development is affected by economic policy uncertainty, investments in renewable energy, human capital, and health expenditure. The G7 economies’ panel data from 2005 to 2021 was used to verify the assertions using the GMM estimate. Additional generalized method of moment (GMM) tests, including a one-step test and a two-step test with a robust check, are used to estimate the variables in this study. The research shows that economic policy uncertainty and health expenditure have negative effects on green economic growth, whereas investments in renewable energy, green finance, human capital, and an ageing population have favorable effects. The research findings direct the formulation of policy implications that would maintain the role of green financing as a growth engine in the Chinese economy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Drawing on ability, motivation, opportunity (AMO) theory, this study seeks to contribute to the burgeoning scholarly discourse encompassing the instrumentality of green competencies (GCs) in catalyzing corporate sustainability performance (CSP). This study seeks to examine direct effect of GCs on CSP, the mediating effects of top management support (TMS) in the relationship between GCs and CSP, the moderating effect of green organizational culture (GOC), and finally the moderated mediation of GOC and TMS in causing GCs to affect CSP. To ascertain the associations among these constructs, three-wave time-lagged and multi-sourced data has been gathered from ISO-14001 certified Saudi firms. The empirical results confirm the hypothesized direct, mediating, moderating, and moderated mediation associations among the subject constructs. While concluding that a requisite accumulation (or cultivation/curation) of GCs, especially in green cultures, can impel top management to enthusiastically bolster green initiatives for superior sustainability performance. In addition, the authors suggest some mechanisms and boundary conditions through which GCs could be astutely deployed to boost CSP. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The survey focused on the perception of respondents regarding the key competencies and the utility of the sustainability development expert occupation (SDE). Based on the assumption that the responses were influenced by multiple factors, the impact of perceptual theory, agency theory and sustainability theory calibrated the analysis of the collected data. Cronbach’s alpha was used to test the reliability of the received responses and multinominal logistic regression with a single dichotomous variable (Regulation Awareness) and several continuous predictor variables (Specialization, Knowledge, Attributions and Competence) was employed to determine to what extent the SDE occupation would contribute to the implementation of sustainable development policies. This paper argues that the ‘green’ competency matrix appropriate for the implementation of sustainable development policies should include executive, compliance promoting, ethical and reporting competencies. The creation of a green competency matrix is an important step toward changing the organisational culture of the public or private sectors to achieve sustainable and reliable development. This research can help organizations and public authorities understand where their efforts should be focused to efficiently incorporate sustainability development into their systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

In today's world, where environmental concerns are constantly increasing, companies must adopt greener innovation strategies. These greener ways of innovating promote the monitoring and preserving of our now endangered environment. Current literature lacks data concerning the necessary skills to ease the implementation of green innovations in certain regions, one of them the Vaasa region in Finland. The aim of this study is therefore to identify those skills that can be diffused through necessary educational programs and training. Such necessary skills can be disseminated through the establishment of a Center of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) in a country or region, being this a suitable way by which educational programs and training can be offered. The skills needed for green innovation in the Vaasa region in Finland were collected through two extensive workshops, a series of semi-structured interviews, and a set of questionnaire surveys. This study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods to meet the expected goals. From the study results, it is noticed that establishing a CoVE can be a good source for the regional companies to get a skilled workforce, which is ultimately essential to adopt a green and sustainable innovation mindset in their products and services development processes.

	abstract = {There are implications to sustainable development from overconsumption of natural resources. Increasingly, economies are running out of resources to sustain or achieve desired growth rates and inclusive growth. As a result, momentum is building on exploring how the blue economy can be used as complimentary resource, particularly as a taping into it as an opportunity of ensuring that the marginalised groups in society are catered for. This is argued to address the ex-ante inequalities in other sectors of the economy, such as the green economy (land and resources on it), where participation by vulnerable groups like women and youth is limited owing to segregation policies of yesteryears, at least in former colonised countries like South Africa. The study used a systematic literature review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols (PRISMA-P) approach to ascertain works on this topic and identify gaps that need to be addressed to adequately inform policy and practice. With regards to access and participation in the blue economy, most studies found that women do have access and participate in the blue economy, however, their participation is limited by barriers such lack of education and credit as well as patriarchal beliefs. Furthermore, women participation in both green and blue economies is determined by social norms, skills attainment, access to credit, age, technology. Most of the reviewed studies concluded that men derived more commercial benefits from green economy, while women derive more subsistence and recreational benefits from the blue economy. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The green transformation is a necessary path for industrialization to reach the advanced stage. Currently, achieving a win-win situation between green transformation and stable employment for residents has become a common concern for theoretical researchers and policymakers. This paper analyzes the influence mechanism of enterprise green transformation on employment using the partial equilibrium model. Furthermore, the employment effect and mechanism of enterprise green transformation are empirically verified with panel data from companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The results indicate a dynamic non-linear relationship between enterprise green transformation and employment. As the transformation deepens, its impact on employment changes from negative to positive. Mechanism analysis reveals that enterprise green transformation has the potential to induce output growth and employment virtuous cycle. Additionally, environmental protection investment and labor employment in the transformation have a factor complementary effect. There is heterogeneity in the employment impact of enterprise green transformation, especially for production personnel, low-skilled labor, non-state-owned, heavy-polluting, and medium-low-tech enterprises, which experience stronger employment deprivation. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Motivation: As governments move in earnest toward a green economy, few countries are considering education policy that can facilitate the development of green skills for such transitions. Where policy discussions are happening, green skills are often conflated with science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) skills, with little attention to the breadth of green skills needed to achieve climate justice. Purpose: We present a green skills framework to help support policy stakeholders imagine a continuum of green skills for a just transition. Methods and approach: This article applies a critical feminist lens to understand how green skills have been conceptualized across the gender and adolescence, greening and sustainability, and education fields. It also integrates the perspectives of stakeholders from climate, education, and gender-focused multilateral, government, and non-governmental organizations working on green skills. Findings: The analysis finds that green skills coalesce around three distinct but overlapping paradigms. The first understands green skills through a technical lens as the specific capacities needed for green jobs. The second and third paradigms understand green skills through a sociological lens, seeking to tackle the behaviours and social structures driving the climate crisis. As such, they centre on cross-cutting generic capacities and transformative capacities, respectively. Taken together, the article offers a new definition of green skills for policy stakeholders. Policy implications: The three approaches to green skills outlined in this paper constitute the pillars of a new green learning agenda for climate action, climate empowerment, and climate justice. This green learning agenda fills a significant void in both climate policy and education policy, and could help governments address current capacity building needs while setting their populations up for the long-term social transformations required to achieve a just transition. © 2022 ODI.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Although the role of human capital in the hospitality sector is critical, the industry faces challenges in attracting workers with a poor industry image frequently mentioned regarding labor shortages. This research paper attempts to investigate the factors influencing labor shortages by presenting the perspectives of employees and employers. Design/methodology/approach: Precisely 232 rural hospitality industry employees (n = 128) and employers (n = 104) in Northern Italy were surveyed using a written close-ended online survey and a quantitative research design as part of a convenience sampling approach. For hypotheses testing, Spearman's rho was used. Findings: A relationship between the shortage of professional workers and a variety of factors was found, including professional, digital, social and green skills, industry-intrinsic characteristics and symbolic image attributes of the industry. The findings show that some factors are more important for employees, while others are more significant for employers. Practical implications: This study demonstrates several practical implications for the hospitality sector by addressing the under-researched stakeholder group of existing hospitality employees, e.g. improving working conditions, reduction of manual operations through digital technologies, realistic career planning, employer branding, identification of skill deficiencies and provision of specialized trainings. Originality/value: Most research on labor shortages in the hospitality industry has focused on the perspective of either employees or employers. This study compares both perspectives, including the industry image, to gain a realistic picture of the relevant factors for a rural tourism destination in Northern Italy. © 2022, Johanna Innerhofer, Luigi Nasta and Anita Zehrer.},

Although technological advances are increasing its sustainability, zero-emission and fuel-efficient manufacturing is still considered a utopian target. Moreover, a primary feature of Industry 4.0 is the digitization of production processes, which offers the opportunity to optimize energy consumption. However, given the speed and often unpredictability with which innovation manifests itself, tools capable of measuring the impact that technology is having professions are still being designed. In light of the above, in this article we present the Worker Profiler, a software designed to map the skills currently possessed by workers, identifying misalignment with those they should ideally possess to meet the renewed demands that digital innovation and environmental preservation impose. In more detail, the authors inferred the key technologies and skills for the topic, isolating those with markedly increasing patent trends and identifying green and digital enabling skills and occupations. Thus, the software was designed and implemented at the user-interface level. The output of the self-assessment is the definition of the missing digital and green skills that enable the definition of a customized retraining strategy. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This article theorizes that two-track institutional approaches, especially the combination of institutional pressure (stick) and institutional support (carrot), are instruments for organizational cognitive manipulation. Building on this, we argue that institutional pressure imposes seem-like corporate political tasks, especially corporate green innovation, on firms. In contrast, institutional support helps firms foster manipulation skills of knowledge via access to external knowledge search and achievement of intellectual property rights. This article employs the Korean Innovation Survey (KIS) data from 2014 to 2016 to test the relationship among institutional pressure, institutional support, and corporate green innovation. Our findings indicate that institutional support positively and significantly impacts a firm&#x0027;s engagement in external knowledge search and its achievement of intellectual property rights. External knowledge search positively and significantly influences the achievement of intellectual property rights. Moreover, external knowledge search and intellectual property rights positively mediate the relationship between institutional support and green innovation.

Therefore, this research study is the first attempt to empirically investigate the impact of green skills and employee green attitudes that may proffer a better explanation of the nature of the relationship between GHRM and the SDGs, proposing an inclusive re`search model on the effect of GHRM on the SDGs in the hi-tech manufacturing industry. Questionnaires were distributed to 465 textile firms; however, of those returned, only 197 surveys completed in all respects were used for further empirical investigation. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data to assess the validity and reliability of the instrument. The outcomes of the study affirmed the theoretical model according to which GHRM has a positive association with employee green attitudes, employee skills, decent work, and sustainable consumption and production behavior. Employee green attitudes and decent work had a positive effect on sustainable consumption and production behavior. It is also beneficial to identify significant moderators to explain the processes and circumstances through which the attitudes of employees are transformed into the desired behaviors. Therefore, individual green values were taken as moderators in the study to assess how they impacted the relationship between GHRM and employee green attitudes, as well as that between employee green attitudes and sustainable consumption and production behavior. The results also revealed that an employee’s green attitude acted as a partial mediator between GHRM and decent work. Moreover, employee green attitudes and employee skills fully mediated between GHRM and sustainable consumption and production behavior. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement: Daunting global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss may seem overwhelming. However, gardeners have a secret weapon—gardens, balconies, indoor planting, yards and allotments are mini-ecosystems that offer opportunities to counter perceptions of helplessness, inadequacy and resultant inaction by using those spaces to ‘Do what we can, with what we have, where we are’. Minimising gardening ‘footprints’ to mitigate harmful impacts, whilst maximising gardening ‘handprints’ to enhance benefits, is readily achievable. With this in mind, the Royal Horticultural Society is leading research into environmental horticulture for gardens, and benefits for individual wellbeing. Summary: This article presents an integrated and applied research approach to the unique and multi-disciplinary area of science referred to here as environmental horticulture. It does this by: (a) providing an institutional perspective (The Royal Horticultural Society) on a research approach for this particular area, emphasising why domestic and community gardens are important in the context of global environmental threats; (b) presenting four primary research focus areas and project examples; and (c) highlighting interdisciplinary linkages, future research needs, public engagement/knowledge sharing opportunities, and ‘Green Skills’ development in the area of environmental horticulture. Research focus areas discussed are: (1) responding to the changing climate (adaptation, mitigation and resilience solutions in gardens); (2) ‘plants for purpose’ (harnessing the potential of horticultural plant diversity, and gardening, to help regulate environmental conditions); (3) sustainability and climate risk reduction through effective and efficient resource management (reduction, re-use, recycling and repurposing); and (4) gardening and cultivated plant choice for human health and wellbeing. We argue that a key research priority is improving our understanding of the linkages and interactions between soil, water, plants, weather and people. These crucial linkages affect above and below ground processes, for both outdoor and indoor plants. They impact the effectiveness with which water and nutrient cycling takes place, the extent to which ecosystem services may be delivered, and the resultant capacity of gardens and gardening to provide environmental and human health benefits. © 2023 The Authors.

We also exploit the extent to which carbon intensity and green skills requirement of jobs contribute to supporting climate policies.

	abstract = {Given the global imperative to meet ‘net zero’, and growing interest in the potential for green jobs growth, there is an urgent need to better understand the drivers and processes underlying green structural economic transitions. How should we in fact define ‘green’ products, jobs and technologies? How do local economies transition into greener jobs – is this generally an incremental process or does it require more radical innovation? Building on nascent green definitions, recent work emerging from the literature in Evolutionary Economic Geography suggests that there is a degree of path dependency to green transitions, with regions benefiting from existing capabilities which are somehow related to newer green tasks and technologies. On the other hand, having diverse, frequently unrelated, skills and competencies also helps local economies to make the recombinations necessary for the emergence of new green activities. These drivers are moderated by factors such as the local institutional environment, IT skills and the degree of maturity of the local industrial base. This article summarises the recent literature in order to provide an overview of emerging findings of relevance to local policy delivery, while also highlighting future research directions. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Online foreign language education is a new mode of green transformation development relying on digital technology. Based on the new background of green technology, this paper focuses on the evaluation of online foreign language teaching satisfaction and the key influencing factors. The entropy weight method was used to construct the evaluation index of online foreign language teaching satisfaction, the multiple linear regression model and confirmatory factor analysis model were used to systematically analyze the main factors affecting the satisfaction, and the questionnaire was used to investigate the data of online foreign language courses such as American Literature, American Culture, College English, Comprehensive English, and History of Foreign Literature. The results show that: (1) college students have a high degree of satisfaction with online foreign language teaching, and the satisfaction index based on entropy weight method is above level 2. (2) Through the multiple linear regression model, the four dimensions of teaching involvement, teaching communication, teaching skills and teaching effect all have a significant impact on the satisfaction of online foreign language teaching. (3) Based on the confirmatory factor model, online foreign language teaching satisfaction is affected by multiple latent and explicit variables, and the effect direction is generally positive. Finally, the paper puts forward specific strategies to improve the effect of green and low-carbon digital technology on foreign language education. © 2023, HARD Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Featured Application: This paper presents a new, fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0)-inspired paradigm for educating and training Australian healthcare professionals and students in the field of digital health. By leveraging Industry 5.0-enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, big data analytics, etc., we can cultivate students to be job-ready for the future of work by providing them with hands-on experience in advanced healthcare technologies. Ultimately, this new training and education paradigm in digital health can help bridge the gap between training and the world of work and prepare students to deliver a more efficient, effective, and sustainable healthcare system. Digital transformation, characterised by advanced digitalisation, blockchain, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning technologies, and robotics, has played a key role in revolutionising various industries, especially the healthcare sector. The adoption of and transition (from traditional) to new technology will bring challenges, opportunities, and disruptions to existing healthcare systems. According to the European Union, we must pursue both digital and green transitions to achieve sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industries to achieve a world of prosperity for all. The study aims to present a novel approach to education and training in the digital health field that is inspired by the fifth industrial revolution paradigm. The paper highlights the role of training and education interventions that are required to support digital health in the future so that students can develop the capacity to recognise and exploit the potential of new technologies. This article will briefly discuss the challenges and opportunities related to healthcare systems in the era of digital transformation and beyond. Then, we look at the enabling technologies from an Industry 5.0 perspective that supports digital health. Finally, we present a new teaching and learning paradigm and strategies that embed Industry 5.0 technologies in academic curricula so that students can develop their capacities to embrace a digital future and minimise the disruption that will inevitably accompany it. By incorporating Industry 5.0 principles into digital health education, we believe students can gain a deeper understanding of the industry and develop skills that will enable them to deliver a more efficient, effective, and sustainable healthcare system. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Green Technology refers to clean energy production, the use of alternative fuels, and technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels. It has garnered a significant amount of interest due to increasing awareness about the impacts of climate change and the depletion of natural resources. While the buildings emit more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases than other industries, the use of Green Technology will be able to reduce human impacts on the natural environment and prevent climate change. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the Green Technology Elements for Construction Technology in Vocational College that is seen fundamental as these students will be in the construction workforce in the future. The study was conducted using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) involving a combination of 20 experts with various expertise from a heterogeneous group. A set of questionnaires using a 7-point Likert Scale was formed based on expert interviews in the first phase of this study and the data obtained were then analysed using triangular fuzzy numbers and ranking for each variable was determined using the defuzzification process. The findings showed that all elements listed reached the experts’ consensus. Expert consensus also found that the Carbon Initiatives element ranked first meanwhile the Introduction to Green Technology element ranked last in the list of elements. These elements are agreed upon in preparing academically exemplary individuals while ensuring every graduate from Vocational College, especially from the Construction Technology course is equipped with job-ready skills to tackle real-life problems. © 2023 UTHM Publisher.

This article focuses on Hong Kong but refers to Denmark (one of the Nordic countries participated in the study) as it scores much higher than China on the GSCI. The assumption of this study is that Denmark’s experience can help formulate policies and the strategic actions required for building sustainable development (SD) solutions for economic green growth through innovation and skills development in Hong Kong. The study used a qualitative methodology. Data was collected through desk-top research and interviews with stakeholders from both settings. The results identified a clear distinction between innovation and greening in terms of education and skills, the business sectors involved, support modalities (policies), investment, as well as culture in both Denmark and Hong Kong SAR. Despite the very different approaches to innovation and variations in both industry structure and the environment for training and skills development, the challenges to industry and their implications for TVET in terms of greening and innovation were found to be very similar in the two contexts. Thus, contrary to the study’s assumptions, this article discusses the similar policy responses to these ‘green’ challenges for both contexts, as well as recommended policy goals and strategic actions with implications for TVET that can support green innovation in both settings. © 2023 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.},

This paper also examines institutional support as a moderator between GI and sustainable performance. The data from 329 SMEs using multi-respondent and time-lagged strategies were collected and analyzed using “structural equation modeling.” The results demonstrate that leaders' competencies significantly predicted GEO and GI, while GI strongly influences economic performance. Additionally, the association between GI and sustainable performance is strengthened by institutional support. Theoretically, this study empirically tested that leaders' sustainable competencies can lead to GI and sustainable performance. For practitioners, this study proposes that institutional support is an important factor that should be properly exploited for better social, environmental, and economic performance. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Preparing learners for the world of work now requires an understanding of what skills workers will need to adequately address these changes. To deal with this issue, the research community has started to define “sustainability competences” and “green skills” to support educationalists and decision-makers to better manage the impact of sustainability on future jobs. However, in the current literature, the difference between “sustainability competences” and “green skills” is not clear. The aim of this article is to highlight the differences between the two concepts in order to support the dialogue between the various disciplines that address these topics. This paper is a scoping review that provides an outline of the scientometric analyses of publications in the field of sustainability, from the earliest in 1998 up to July 2023. Although the terms are interrelated, using the R package for analysis shows that “green skills” tends to refer more to specific environmental technical skills, while “sustainability competences” are primarily defined as key competences to promote the different dimensions of sustainability, i.e., competences useful for holistic human development. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article examines the role of Vocational Education and Training (VET) in a green transition of industry. In the world of industry, battling climate change is often treated as a technical issue, but recent research on VET has tried to balance the technological paradigm with more human-centric approaches. The literature review addresses emergent VET research that presents various and partially competing perspectives on the purpose of VET in relation to climate change. Methods: We use an integrative literature review to investigate this complex topic. This technique is particularly useful for making sense of emergent research concepts, as well as various, and partially competing, theoretical and methodological approaches. It also allows us to incorporate literature from different countries and VET systems. The main search was performed in Scopus during March 2023, and included studies published within a timespan of eight years (2016–2023). Findings: Through a qualitative content analysis, we have identified five cross-cutting themes in the literature: Conceptualising ill-defined concepts of green jobs and skills; high-tech solutions in the movement towards a fourth industrial revolution versus inclusive growth for VET greening; towards sustainable work-based learning for green skills in VET; radical transformative approaches to a just green transition; and the co-creation of skill-formation ecosystems. The analysis has highlighted the ways in which VET can take on different roles in the green transition, and that these roles can be developed successively in parallel with a green transition in industry. In the development of the role of VET, it is also relevant to consider the contrast between transitional approaches and transformative approaches in VET research. While transitional approaches are recurrently marked by empirical research in specialised areas and subsystems within society, transformative approaches are characterised by a stronger focus on societal transformation (large-scale changes), power dynamics, and social justice. Conclusion: In conclusion, we suggest an analytical model that synthesises research on what role VET can play in a green transition of industry. The development model highlights that VET can take on different roles in a green transition and can gradually develop in parallel with a green transition in industry. © 2023 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

	abstract = {If oil sands are to be eliminated from the energy market to protect the global environment, human health and long-term economic welfare, a significant number of workers will be displaced in the transition to renewable energy technologies. This study outlines a cost-effective and convenient path for oil and gas workers in Alberta to be retrained in the burgeoning solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. Many oil and gas workers would be able to transfer fields with no additional training required. This study examines retraining options for the remainder of workers using the most closely matching skill equivalent PV job to minimize retraining time. The costs for retraining all oil sands workers are quantified and aggregated. The results show the total costs for retaining all oil sands workers in Alberta for the PV industry ranges between CAD$91.5 m and CAD$276.2 m. Thus, only 2–6% of federal, provincial, and territorial oil and gas subsidies for a single year would need to be reallocated to provide oil and gas workers with a new career of approximately equivalent pay. The results of this study clearly show that a rapid transition to sustainable energy production is feasible as costs of retraining oil and gas workers are far from prohibitive. © 2023, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.},

	abstract = {The Green SCENT project aims to educate European citizens to acquire green skills within the eight Focus Areas identified by the EU Green Deal Communication. The funded project involves 15 partners from 10 European countries. The very first outcome of the project is to build a competence framework for shaping the future environmental education of European citizens. The task specifically involved 13 researchers, organised into 8 teams (one for each focus area addressed by the Green Deal communication) who worked on the project for approximately 11 months (January to November 2022). The aim of the project described in this study was to establish competences, and their specificities in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes, creating a competence framework on sustainability issues and incorporating the feedback and insights of stakeholders by placing them as co-creators. From the developed competence framework, an interactive knowledge graph of competences was created as a practical tool to present and exploit the competence framework. This was then used to incorporate the bottom-up perspective and open up a discussion on research that hitherto had a top-down scientific approach only with competence elicited from literature data. In this paper the identified competences for the focus areas of Circular Economy, Clean Energy and Smart Mobility are used as case study. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the importance of innovative stakeholder contributions obtained through the Delphi study, the workshops and the assemblies with citizens of all ages, backgrounds and educational levels. The ultimate knowledge artefact consists of more than 120 competences articulated in over 2500 knowledge, skills and attitude descriptions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Using 30 provincial panel data sets of China from 2011 to 2020, this paper explores whether green finance will effectively impact the rise of China’s manufacturing value chain using green finance as the breakthrough point. The results show that: (1) The implementation of green finance policy has a promoting effect on the rise of the manufacturing value chain. (2) It has significant regional heterogeneity characteristics in the process of green finance that influence the manufacturing value chain. In the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, the role of green finance in regions with developed economic bases is superior to those in comparatively backward areas. (3) Innovation and technological development are significant factors in the development of the manufacturing industry, and the intensity of innovative development inputs as well as the labour factor of highly skilled workers have a moderating role in the process of green finance for climbing up the value chain status of manufacturing.

Existing studies focus on the effectiveness of green advertising from the level of message content and message expression, but there is little research to assess the advertising effectiveness of green advertising being “well said” from the perspective of message quality. This article constructs a theoretical framework based on the theory of communication persuasion to assess the effect of perceived message quality on the consumer’s green response to green advertising. Study 1 constructs an econometric regression model by crawling unstructured data, such as green ad review texts through Python, and verifies that consumers’ green responses (green purchase intention and green sharing intention) are mainly influenced by green ad information usefulness, information attractiveness and information truthfulness. Study 2 further tested the direct role of perceived green advertising information quality on the consumer’s green response by constructing structural equation models with situational experimental data, and verified the mediating role of green competence trust and green value trust in the process of perceived green advertising information quality influence on the consumer’s green response. These findings provide a new theoretical perspective on the effectiveness of green advertising, while providing practical guidance for green brand owners to develop green advertising strategies and assess green advertising quality. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The natural resources around the community encourage people to develop knowledge and skills in managing them. In anthropology, this is known as local wisdom. The people of Simeulue have local wisdom in managing coconut resources. Recently, the coconut and its derivatives industry in Simeulue Island have experienced a decline in production due to a shortage of raw materials. Existing coconut plantations are no longer productive due to age and unfortunately, revitalisation efforts have not been maximised. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the cultural barriers in the revitalisation process of coconut plantations in Simeulue Island, Aceh Province, Indonesia. This study uses ethnographic methods with a qualitative approach. Data collection relies on observation and interviews, applying the principles of living-in and progressive contextual principles. The results indicate that the cultural bonds between the Simeulu people and coconuts have become a matter of pride. However, this pride has contributed to the stagnation of coconut plantation revitalization, as the majority is reluctant to replace old coconut trees with young ones. This reluctance manifests as a cultural orientation that tends to venerate old coconut plantations as monuments to the memory of ancestors that must be preserved. Meanwhile, the coconut industry requires a sustainable supply of raw materials to meet market demand. Livelihood patterns that do not focus on a single job also hinder revitalization. Therefore, it is essential to raise community awareness. Incorporating a productivity-oriented approach to coconut plantations will only succeed if rejuvenation is carried out through participatory planning, taking into account the local wisdom associated with the value of coconut plantations. © 2024 Horizon Research Publishing.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the development of green skills across firms located in an institutional context, specifically the national education and skill-formation system, of the under-researched developing country of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: This paper qualitatively explores the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand. The empirical findings in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders; field visits to vocational colleges, universities, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) and firms across industries both in Bangkok and in other provinces in Thailand; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. Findings: This paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road human resource (HR) practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research concern its methodology. This research is based on the qualitative studies of the Thai education and skill-formation system and a case study of firms across industries in Thailand. Thus, this paper does not aim to generalize the findings to all other countries but to enrich the discussion on the effects of macro-level HR policies on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills across firms in each country. Additionally, it is difficult to gain access to firms across several industries and various stakeholders to understand the development of green skills among employees in these firms. The reasons are resource constraints, time constraints and the hesitation of firms in permitting the author to access the data. These difficulties have restricted the sources of information to construct a more nuanced picture of firms across various industries in developing green skills among their existing employees. Consequently, this research does not include firms in several other industries, including the pulp and paper industry, textile and garment industry, plastic industry and agri-food industry. Thus, future research may extend the topic of the development of green skills among employees to these industries. Quantitative studies using large samples of firms across industries may also be useful in deepening the understanding of this topic, which is significant from the perspectives of the strategic human resource management (SHRM), comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and green economy. Practical implications: This paper also provides practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers of firms in Thailand, other developing countries and other emerging market economies with deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system. First, the top managers and/or HR managers can apply various methods to internally develop managers and employees/workers with the appropriate environmental/green knowledge and necessary skills to perform green jobs. The methods include classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems, job shadowing and being role models for younger generations of employees. Second, these top managers and/or HR managers can cooperate with vocational colleges and/or universities in their countries to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for their firms. These managers can request for assistance from universities in their countries when their firms confront sophisticated questions/problems related to environmental/green management. In this regard, universities will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries, while firms can appropriately and accurately solve environmental/green questions/problems. Third, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their firms to apply for certificates of green-/environmentally friendly products or carbon footprint labels from NGOs to foster a green image among firms' consumers. These applications require the firms to pay special attention to the cultivation of green awareness and the development of green skills among their employees. Fourth, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their employees to express green-/environmentally friendly behaviors as well as sufficiency-based consumption behaviors. In fact, these top managers and/or HR managers can foster their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for young generations. Fifth, these top managers and/or HR managers can adopt and implement green human resource management (GHRM) practices consisting of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations in their firms to upgrade both the environmental and social performances of firms. Finally, these top managers and/or HR managers must take serious actions regarding the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices within their firms in order to facilitate the movement of the country toward the bioeconomy, circular economy, and green economy (BCG economy). Social implications: This paper provides social/policy implications for the government, vocational colleges and universities in Thailand, other developing countries and emerging market economies where the skill shortage problem is still severe. First, the government of each country should incorporate green/environmental policies into the national education policy and the long-term strategic plan of the country. Second, the government should continuously implement such national policy and strategic plan by encouraging government agencies, vocational colleges, universities, firms and NGOs to cooperate in developing and offering environmental/green management educational programs/curricula to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for those firms. Third, the government should encourage vocational colleges and universities to equip their students with green skills to be industry-ready in a real working context. Fourth, to alleviate the skill shortage problem in the labor market, the government should foster firms, especially private sector firms, to focus on the upskilling and reskilling of their existing employees. With this action, their existing employees will have green skills, be able to effectively perform green jobs and become an important driver to help the country move toward the BCG economy. Fifth, the government of each country should encourage firms to develop green-/environmentally friendly products by offering them various types of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions. Sixth, the government should encourage universities in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration. This action can ultimately facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to those university students who will finally return to work in their home country. Seventh, the government, especially the Ministry of Education, should encourage vocational colleges and universities to teach students in the environmental/green management program based on real case studies/problems found across firms. In this way, graduates should be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Finally, the government must pay serious attention to the implementation of environmental/green management policies across levels within the country so that the transition of the country toward the BCG economy will finally come true in the future. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the SHRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and the literature on the green economy and the development of green skills in firms in the following ways. First, this paper focuses on examining how the institutional context of Thailand shapes the development of green knowledge and skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In this regard, the paper aims to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should go beyond the organizational context and examine how firms adopt and implement HR practices in response to the national institutional context. Second, the paper aims to extend the literature on the green economy regarding the roles played by institutional factors in shaping the development of green knowledge and skills across firms. Finally, strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy studies have overlooked the under-researched country of Thailand. Most studies in these three areas focus more on developed countries. Thus, the findings of this paper should extend the literature on those areas regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the Thai institutional context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Green innovations are the most critical factor in promoting environmental sustainability worldwide. Trade can speed up the adoption of green innovations by facilitating the transfer of information, skills, and technology. However, trade policy uncertainty can create significant challenges for businesses investing in eco-innovations, leading to increased risk, reduced investment, and slower progress toward sustainable technologies. Recently, a growing number of researchers have shown their interest in finding the factors that can impact green innovations, but none have investigated the influence of trade policy uncertainty on green innovations in the USA and China. In addition, none of the past studies has relied on the nonlinear assumption. This analysis fills these gaps by examining the nonlinear impacts of trade policy uncertainty on eco-innovations in China and the USA over 2000Q1–2021Q4 by employing a nonlinear ARDL model. The finding reveals that a positive shock in trade policy uncertainty results in a decrease in green innovation in the USA and China, while a negative shock in trade policy uncertainty leads to an increase in green innovation in the USA over the long run. The nonlinear models also indicate that a positive shock in trade policy uncertainty harms green innovation in both the USA and China in the short run. The robustness of these results is confirmed by the NQARDL model, which confirms that an upsurge in trade policy uncertainty lowers green innovation in most quantiles in the USA and China in the short and long run. Conversely, negative shocks in trade policy uncertainty stimulate green innovation at most quantiles in both China and the USA, in the short and long run. Thus, policymakers need to consider the potential impact of trade policies on eco-innovations and work to create stable and predictable trade environments that support the growth of renewable technologies and other sustainable solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Green competencies (GCs) are recognised in the business management literature as those related to all the dimensions of the concept of sustainable development (SD). However, the relationship between GCs and sustainable business practices (SBPs) is not well defined; GCs are often presented in the context of selected organisational activities or the sector of the economy. This paper aims to present the inf luence of SBPs on employees’ GCs in the transport and logistics sec-tor. To achieve this goal, the combination of the methods was employed. First, a classical and semi-bibliometric literature review was undertaken to explore the connection between GCs and SBPs in the literature. Subsequently, the collection of good sustainable practices gathered by the Polish business ethics organisation Forum Odpowiedzialnego Biznesu [Responsible Business Forum] (FOB) was re-analysed qual-itatively and quantitatively as a source of SBPs in subjective and objective focus. The analysis of the secondary data col-lected in FOB indicated those SBPs which inf luence employ-ees’ GCs in the transport and logistics sector. As a result of this study, the combined orientation of the SBPs and their inf luence on GCs is conditional for the creation of green jobs (GJs). In this paper, future research avenues are also proposed for studying employees’ competencies in the narrow context of both subjective and objective perspectives and for research into “golden” GJs, the conditions of the sustainable green labour market and green self-employment development. © 2023, WSB University.

	abstract = {Introduction: Global warming and the increase in greenhouse gases are a current concern worldwide. The healthcare sector constitutes about 4.4% of all emissions. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, awareness and attitudes of Therapeutic Radiographers/Radiation Therapists (TR/RTTs) regarding environment-related concepts to inform the development of educational curriculum. Methods: A validated self-designed survey was distributed to TR/RTTs across Europe by the SAFE EUROPE partners and via social media between October 2021 and February 2022. The survey was divided into six sections: (i) demographics, (ii) knowledge of Circular Economy (CE) and Green Skills (GS), (iii) personal attitudes, (iv) TR/RTTs attitudes, (v) the importance of CE, and (vi) education. Questions consisted of mostly Likert scales complemented with other closed- and open-ended questions. Results: 31%–42% of participants are aware of national and departmental policies in CE and GS concepts. Even though half of the participants considered that they advocate and practice CE, the open questions indicated that participants only focus on waste management, ignoring all the other dimensions of CE in healthcare. Personal attitudes and lifestyles also did not reflect CE. TR/RTTs considered CE practices and GS development essential. However, the suggested academic level at which these skills should be developed was split between High School (44%) and Bachelor's degree (32%). Conclusion: It is essential to raise awareness among TR/RTTs about the various dimensions of CE applied to healthcare: “green transportation”, “environment-friendly procurement”, “hospital building design”, “food process optimisation”, “water reduction”, “energy efficiency”, and “waste management”. Implications for practice: These GS must be developed by TR/RTTs to decrease their impact on the environment. Their training may need to be lifelong, starting during basic high school education and continuing as healthcare professionals after graduation. © 2023},

Indeed, many engineers are embarrassed for asking about the effect that technology can have in effective environmental solutions because they will be perceived as less intelligent, distracted, or simply incompetent. However, those who are afraid to ask are ashamed to learn too, and when this happens the reputation of the company suffers. The main purpose of this article is to examine the effect of green skills on organizational reputation through technology assimilation and avoiding embarrassment. A conceptual model was proposed, and the article utilizes data collected through a survey instrument. The data provided by 208 SMEs based in the textile industry is analyzed using SmartPLS 3. Results show that technology assimilation supported by green skills not only could avoid or mitigate the effect of stress, anxiety, and fears caused by embarrassment, but they also support organizational reputation.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

We find that greener and more polluting jobs are concentrated among small subsets of workers, individual workers rarely move from more pollution-intensive to greener jobs, and workers in green-intensive jobs earn on average 7% more than workers in pollution-intensive jobs. Stronger environmental policies are associated with a higher (lower) share of green-(pollution-)intensive jobs and appear to be even more effective when structural policies that incentivize greater flexibility in labor markets are operating. Taken together, the evidence suggests that with the right policies, the green transition for the labor market is manageable but will be tough for some workers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was proposed and tested. Data were collected from 208 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile industry in Valencia, Spain using a survey instrument. Partial least squares (PLS) allowed for the analysis of the data collected. Findings: The theoretical model explains 46.1% of the variation in the organisational reputation variable. The findings indicate that ethical data privacy has a beneficial effect on an organisation's reputation and eco-innovation. The findings also demonstrate how eco-innovation drives the development of new knowledge and green skills that, in turn, communicate to stakeholders a company's ethical commitment. These results should encourage SMEs to invest in data privacy in order to meet the needs of the SMEs' increasingly technology- and environment-sensitive stakeholders and to improve their reputation. Originality/value: This study provides the first empirical evidence that ethical data privacy management has a positive impact on the reputation of firms. Furthermore, the originality of the research derives from the analysis of the results from an environmental perspective.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms (board size, independent commissioner and ownership concentration) on green innovation (GI) in publicly traded companies of Indonesia as an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: Archival data relating to CG and GI were collected for five years (2016–2020). A total of 640 observations were obtained and analyzed using a random effect model. Findings: The results indicate that effective governance mechanisms can encourage GI implementation to promote company sustainability. Respectively, the board size, independent commissioner and ownership concentration positively and significantly affect GI. These results imply that the optimal board size will result in effective coordination and cooperation in making GI decisions. Likewise, the proportional independent commissioners in the board structure will serve an effective oversight function. And concentrated ownership can influence executives to prefer innovation policies, such as GI. Research limitations/implications: First, only a few CG mechanisms were used in this investigation. Therefore, further research needs to consider other mechanisms such as the number of commissioners, internal and external commissioners. Second, this research focused solely on Indonesia as an emerging market. Future research can be expanded to include countries with other emerging market characteristics. Third, different GI measurements from this study should be considered in future studies. Practical implications: Practically, the results of this study are expected to provide policy recommendations, including optimizing the CG mechanisms as a control tool to achieve organizational sustainability through GI according to stakeholder expectations. This can be achieved by optimizing the size of the board of directors. The low value of the board size coefficient implies that optimization of board size is needed to encourage GI. The company can gain directors’ competence, experience and skill to increase innovation performance. In addition, maximizing the role of independent commissioners in overseeing is required for continuous innovation activities. Finally, the control of large shareholders is also necessary to encourage the implementation of GI because they could influence management to make innovative decisions. Originality/value: This study extends and contributes to the extant CG and GI literature. There is little evidence that reveals how CG mechanisms affect GI, particularly in emerging market settings. The findings offer some important evidence for improving CG in driving GI implementation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Five experts were involved in the first phase and eleven experts were involved in the validation process in the second phase. The lowest items score based on the expert’s consensus were rejected. Three items were rejected because of the score less than 75 per cent. The final competency profile consisting of Skill, Knowledge, and Attitude domains with 14 sub domains was constructed. The current scenario shows that people entering the industrial world lack relevant skills to work on sustainable development. These workers are classified as low-skilled workers, which means they need to be trained before entering the labor market. This study can support the development of training towards sustainability for future workers in the mechanical industry towards sustainability. Therefore, specific training related to their professional skills, especially green skills, needs to be carried out to improve their skills. © 2023 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

This paper deals with a part of the work developed in the early stage of a current Erasmus+ project, which aims at developing an industry-driven and proactive skills strategy to assist the implementation and exploitation of industrial symbiosis and energy efficiency across the energy intensive sectors. The paper presents the current state of workforce in the context of industrial symbiosis and energy efficiency implementations. The most recent literature on the effects of new skills requirement and training needs for the European process industry workforce is analyzed and discussed. In addition, implementation advantages and barriers as well as possible solutions to satisfy ongoing and future skill demands are considered. Through skill integrations and workforce attraction and training, new skills, and greater abilities for working across sector boundaries can be achieved. In addition, policies on green economy and on skills development can enable anticipating labor market changes, by identifying skill requirement impacts. This can be achieved by introducing new training programs, revising existing ones and by monitoring the impact of trainings on the labor market. © 2022 by the authors.},

This article examines whether socially disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups are more vulnerable to occupational displacement in the green transition because their existing skills are less suitable to green jobs and because they reside in counties that are not rich in green jobs. Multivariate regression analysis is used to test this hypothesis, combining newly available county-level data on green jobs with socioeconomic and demographic information. The results show significant racial disparities, even after accounting for educational attainment and rural domiciles. Native American and Black-majority counties have fewer green jobs, amounting to about one standard deviation lower than the average county. The data does not show evidence of ethnic disparities in the distribution of green jobs. The analysis reveals that policies targeted toward enhancing or acquiring skills required for green jobs are urgently needed, particularly in socially disadvantaged racial communities, to ensure that the green transition is just and inclusive.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

We explore the direct linkages between SMEs’ skills and strategic agility using GMM (Gaussian mixed model) model results between green human resource management and government other caps. Expenditure. For market capitalizing agility, all estimates produce a favorable and statistically significant effect at 5% level or higher. However, the coefficient of strategic agility (STA) is only statistically significant at 1% level when using GMM model results. According to the GMM model results, the estimates for technological capability and education spending are 0.055 and 0.091, respectively. Other results and outcomes provide credence to H2a. On the one hand, network capability has (+) significant effects on both firm age (b3 = 0.20; t = 4.10; p 0.01) and strategic agility (b1 = 0.33; t = 2.22; p 0.01). On the other hand, strategic agility has significant positive effects on internationalization knowledge (IKW) (b2 = 0.24; t = 4.08; p 0.01).

	abstract = {The study aims to empirically examine the effect of carbon-neutrality policies on the key resources needed for Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing and how these resources can provide a sustainable competitive advantage. The theoretical framework is integrated with the institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV). The empirical method is used for collecting data through surveys and further covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to test the hypotheses. Findings indicate that carbon–neutral-based government policies have a stronger influence on tangible resources and human skills than intangible resources related to Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing. Second, carbon–neutral policy alignment with the firm's sustainability objectives plays a moderating effect on the relationship between carbon–neutral-based government policies and resources (tangible, intangible resources and human skills) for Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing. Lastly, the three resources (tangible, intangible resources and human skills) for Industry 4.0 driven smart manufacturing play a critical role in developing firms’ carbon–neutral capability and further enhancing operational performance. Managerial implications include investment in advanced digital technologies, developing a strong mindset among employees and supply chain stakeholders, and designing training programs for enhancing smart manufacturing performance to develop carbon-neutrality capability. This study proposes a hybrid theory in the context of carbon neutrality by integrating institutional theory and RBV. This is the first study that examines the effect of carbon neutrality-based government policies on vital Industry 4.0-driven smart manufacturing resources and the indirect effect on carbon neutrality capability and operational performance. © 2023},

We compare a range of gross job employment factors which indicate that overall, investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency can deliver more jobs than gas or coal power generation. In addition, we review a subset of recent studies which estimate the net employment effects of decarbonisation in the energy sector at a national scale, across various international contexts. These national studies largely agree that the most likely outcome over the next few decades is a modest net positive creation of jobs and moderate economic growth. In certain regions within these countries, jobs in fossil fuel industries may be lost faster than the pace at which low carbon energy sectors can offer new employment. There may be mismatches between regions where displaced workers live and where new opportunities become available, which may be a barrier to accepting alternative employment even if former workers have the requisite skills. In these cases national government transition plans are recommended, coordinated with local governments, to manage the impacts of displacement from carbon-intensive sectors and respond to the need to build a new low carbon workforce including through skills development and training. We highlight a lack of metrics and data in the literature on job quality, skills, and the geographic distribution of employment impacts in decarbonising energy systems, and these should be priority areas for further research. © 2024, Crown.},

	abstract = {Contamination of the environment through toxic pollutants poses a key risk to the environment due to irreversible environmental damage(s). Industrialization and urbanization produced harmful elements such as petrochemicals, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials, and herbicides that are intentionally or unintentionally released into the water system, threatening biodiversity, the health of animals, and humans. Heavy metals (HMs) in water, for example, can exist in a variety of forms that are inclined by climate features like the presence of various types of organic matter, pH, water system hardness, transformation, and bioavailability. Biological treatment is an important tool for removing toxic contaminants from the ecosystem, and it has piqued the concern of investigators over the centuries. In situ bioremediation such as biosparging, bioventing, biostimulation, bioaugmentation, and phytoremediation and ex-situ bioremediation includes composting, land farming, biopiles, and bioreactors. In the last few years, scientific understanding of microbial relations with particular chemicals has aided in the protection of the environment. Despite intensive studies being carried out on the mitigation of toxic pollutants, there have been limited efforts performed to discuss the solutions to tackle the limitations and approaches for the remediation of heavy metals holistically. This paper summarizes the risk assessment of HMs on aquatic creatures, the environment, humans, and animals. The content of this paper highlights the principles and limitations of microbial remediation to address the technological challenges. The coming prospect and tasks of evaluating the impact of different treatment skills for pollutant remediation have been reviewed in detail. Moreover, genetically engineered microbes have emerged as powerful bioremediation capabilities with significant potential for expelling toxic elements. With appropriate examples, current challenging issues and boundaries related to the deployment of genetically engineered microbes as bioremediation on polluted soils are emphasized. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The moderation effects of R&D investment and top management commitment reflect the national context in Iraq, where R&D investment is low and management is often constrained by inflexible bureaucracy.

Second, firms that increase their Green Score generate more green patents, and those green patents are of higher quality and receive more citations. Third, traditional ratings widely used to evaluate firms’ environmental efforts do not consider firms’ Green Score.

	abstract = {The aging of populations and the labour force, combined with the process of digitalisation, have a significant im-pact on labour markets, employment, and labour rights worldwide. Industries and jobs that rely on age-appre-ciating skills, which improve with age, are positively af-fected by both aging and digitalisation, since automation compensates for the lower physical abilities of older workers, thereby increasing their productivity. On the other hand, automation threatens physical and routine jobs that require low skills. In this paper, the authors used an empirical approach and inductive method to analyse the simultaneous influence of aging and digitalisation on workforce skills and demand for employees. In the future, governments' efforts to stimulate employment and decent work should include providing high-quality education that prepares the workforce to gain and upgrade creative and social skills. These changes require policy and regulatory interventions to address the issues of skill shifts and the transition towards both digital and green economies, while simultaneously promoting and standing for decent work conditions. This presupposes that businesses introduce and adopt sustainable, dynamic, and inclusive workplace practices. The authors propose the age management mechanism as a human resource tool, as well as its legal counterpart, the age-responsible due diligence approach, for managing the necessary changes. © 2023 Demographic Research Centre.

	abstract = {Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) reflects the aspect of human resource management in environmental management, and it focuses on the role of human resources in preventing pollution through the operational processes of a business. GHRM plays a vital role in environmental management as the human resource function also plays an important role in achieving the company's goals of a green company. Therefore, this study aims to identify the direct effect of the Green Human Resource Management variable on the participation of farmer group members and the indirect effect of Organizational Commitment as a mediating variable. The population of this study was all farmer group members in Tirtomartani Village with a total of 510 members. The determination of the sample used the cluster random sampling technique because the groups have similar characteristics such as farming behavior, level of education, farming patterns, plants planted, size of fields, to the organizational structure of each farmer group. This study used a five-point Likert scale with 5 for strongly agree and 1 for strongly disagree. Data were collected from 110 respondents. The analysis was performed with the help of SmartPLS with the Path Analysis Method. The results showed that Green Recruitment and Selection, Green Training, Green Performance Management, and Green Payment and Reward have a positive and significant effect on the participation of farmer group members, while Green Involvement did not. Moreover, organizational commitment cannot be used as a mediating variable in this research model. Farmer groups had programs to develop skills, knowledge and attitudes related to good environmental management so that the participation of their members' increased. A successful organization means that each member pays more attention to green performance targets, and indicators of green performance success, evaluate green performance and reduce errors that affect the decline in the predetermined green performance. © 2022 WITPress.

We, however, observe increased investments in highly skilled personnel and compensated with employee stock ownership, especially by firms under intense pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Such initiatives are also closely associated with the significant enhancement of workplace safety. Overall, LCC helps to upgrade the corporate labour structure by hiring more skilled employees through reduced agency problems and heightened green innovation. © 2023},

	abstract = {The quest for green growth through the sustainable use of natural resources (NRs) and innovation in information and communication technologies (IICTs) has gained the utmost significance in the modern era, and the knowledge-based economies (KBEs) have been at the leading edge of embracing sustainable methods for accomplishing sustainable development objectives. However, the relationship between NRs, IICTs, and green growth remain unexplored. This study evaluates the impact of IICTs and NRs, alongside other key factors such as contractionary export policy (CEP), expansionary export policy (EEP), fossil fuels consumption (FFC), the labor force (LF), and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) on green growth. Findings confirm that IICTs, NRs, GFCF, LF, and EEP positively affect green growth. The current research employs Slope homogeneity test, cross-sectional dependency test, Westerlund and Edgerton cointegration test, and cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lag estimator to achieve the study's objective. These results highlight the significance of integrating environmentally conscious procedures and relying on technological advances within the information and communication technology sector to promote green development and ecological integrity. In addition, the study indicates that a growing reliance on FFC and the implementation of CEP harm green growth, underscoring the necessity of moving to renewable energy sources and promoting favorable trade policies. This study suggests that policymakers should emphasize IICTs, effective NRs management, GFCF, labor skills, EEP, and the transition to greener energy. Moreover, they should incorporate ecological factors in their trade practices to reconcile economic growth with sustainability goals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This review assesses how sustainability and green jobs are changing in response to these formidable challenges, with a focus on energy transitions and responsible production and consumption. The energy transition to renewable sources will generate a net increase in employment, although some regions of the world may see net losses. Jobs in responsible consumption and production, motivated by changing consumer demand and savings from circular economy strategies, will increase the number of green and sustainability jobs. Since sustainability and green jobs require higher levels of creative problem-solving, more nonroutine activities, formal education, and on-the-job training than traditional jobs, more training will be necessary to meet skills demands in green and sustainability positions. We review how competency and capacity approaches to learning, credentialing, and on-the-job training have been employed to meet growing demand for sustainability and green jobs.

And then the instrumental variable method (IV-Oprobit) is used for endogeneity treatment and robustness test. The results show that: (1) Cooperative education and training time can significantly promote the green production willingness of members. Specifically, for every additional hour of education and training, the probability of “very willing” to participate in green production increases by 1.7%; (2) the four types of education and training methods of cooperative project demonstration, on-site training, bulletin board publicity, and online information publicity are all positively affecting the willingness of members to green production, and on-site training is the most effective method; (3) the three education and training contents of cognition, emotion and skills all positively affect the green production intention of members, and cognition is the most effective content; (4) the methods and contents of cooperative education and training have an interactive effect on the influence of members' green production willingness. Based on this, this paper proposes policy suggestions to optimize the functions, training methods, and content design of green production education and training in cooperatives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Compared to tango dance, the paper discusses the co-management approach, combining two disciplines with other goals and expectations. The methodology adapts brainstorming for studying environmental engineering to improve students' competencies and diversify study methods. Studying classical idea co-creation approaches in higher education, evaluating their results, and analysing stakeholders’ opinions - involving 65 students, six industry and government representatives, and 14 lecturers. This study identified crucial factors that form a model for successful collaboration between academia and industry to train environmental science specialists and develop green innovations. These factors include party participation activity, the definition of primary evaluation criterion, and student motivation. The study concludes that the co-management approach could enhance competence education quality by promoting skill diversification and teamwork and providing greater motivation to work. © 2023 The Authors},

Underpinned by the CARE-KNOW-DO theoretical principles, we explore CCSE issues and provide a novel foundation for a new education movement to combine strategies, initiatives, and interventions towards learning ecologies. Findings of our Delphi Study with 27 expert academics, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policymakers of the UK Green-Forum presents seven recommendations to tackle the CCSE’s challenges: 1. Promote flexible real-context curriculum; 2. Foster cross-curricular practices with teachers’ training; 3. Establish CCSE definition with benchmarks including skills and qualifications; 4. Enhance learners’ agency through the cooperation of stakeholders and organisations; 5. Raise students’ passion for nature with a hopeful curriculum; 6. Increase green careers awareness through education, and 7. Implement tangible curriculum through policy-change with equity, diversity and inclusion.

	abstract = {Green and decent work in the Global South is inextricably linked to sustaining rural livelihoods especially in agriculture that has undergone significant deskilling under the top-down, technocentric assemblages of the Green Revolution. Additionally, agrarian communities are also seeing youth quitting farming occupations in search of better livelihood options. Scholarly attention to green transitions though has been largely limited to the ecological dimensions. Enacting futures with a focus on ecologically responsible livelihoods need to go beyond existing narratives of technocentric and economic change and foreground the diverse micro institutional innovations that offer newer framings of reskilling. The growing evidence of agroecological initiatives across India indicates less discussed stories of transformation and innovations. Recognising the processes and linkages that allow for, and hinder, transformations at multiple scales and organisational levels is crucial for designing transformative initiatives and policies. Using two illustrative case studies, this paper explores opportunities for green work and the newer skills that might be required to enable sustainable agri-food systems. The case of Natural Farming Fellows (NFFs), a unique programme to encourage young agri-graduates to pursue Natural Farming is presented to understand enabling processes at the grassroots level. The second study explores institutional initiatives to engage rural youth through discussing the pedagogy and curricular approach of a Gandhian university along with opportunities to intern with field organisations. Together, these cases illustrate possible pathways and complexities underlying the process of nurturing sustainable livelihoods, the conception of which needs a broader idea of skilling based on personal aspirations and institutional support. © 2023 by the authors.},

This study maps the scope and structure of circularity in the manufacturing SC discipline and explores the evolution of the domain over time. We review 946 journal articles published between 2013 and September 2023. Our study identifies key drivers and barriers to circular economy (CE) deployment in manufacturing SC operations, bibliometric parameters, emerging research themes, decision support tools, theories and applications. Using the theory extension approach, we propose a strategic framework to fortify the deployment of circularity in SCs. This comprehensive study renders a methodological contribution through combined descriptive content analysis and bibliometric and network analyses to evaluate the circular manufacturing SC operations concepts, theories and applications. We posit that manufacturing firms require to deploy innovation-led approaches to embed the CE strategies in their SC operations. We find that the studies investigating green skill development and circularity-culture adoption can facilitate manufacturers to understand the efficacy of circularity in their SC operations. The findings of this study can facilitate the practitioners to identify the links between the CE approaches and their strategic implications and examine CE implementation at the strategic level. © 2024 The Authors.

As well as acknowledged process intensification methods such as microwave support for energy efficiency to move towards climate neutral operation, digital twins combined with process analytical technology for advanced process control enables reliable operation of an optimal operation point regarding lowest cost of goods, as well as lowest global warming potential equivalent. A novel process control enabled by digital twin technology has shown to reduce the ecological footprint of the extraction by up to 46.5%, while reducing the cost of extraction by 22.4%. Additionally, skilled operator time is reduced, and the sustainable plant material is utilized most efficiently. The approach is ready to apply, but broad industrialization seems to be held back by unclear business cases and lack of comprehension of decision makers. This is in drastic contrast to the political demand for climate neutrality goals and the cost pressure by worldwide completion. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Green innovation is crucial to the sustainable development of corporates. The executive’s environmental protection background has an impact on their comprehensive skills, value orientation, management style, and behavioral patterns, thus playing an important role in corporate green innovation strategy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between executives’ environmental protection background and corporate green innovation and its boundary mechanisms. Using data of A-share listed companies in China from 2007 to 2021, this relationship was empirically investigated using Stata analysis software and the establishment of a fixed-effects analysis model. Based on the upper echelons theory, this study finds that executive environmental protection background positively affects corporates’ green innovation. The above positive relationship persists when measures of green innovation and alternative regression models address robustness. Furthermore, this study explores the moderating role of the external environment and internal organizational factors (i.e., media attention and board independence). This study concludes that media attention and board independence positively moderate the positive relationship between executives’ environmental protection background and green innovation. The study contributes to the upper echelons theory and provides new insights into green innovation in emerging economies. © 2023 by the authors.},

This is particularly important for the tourism labour market, which was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the effect of carbon taxes on tourism employment for European countries that have levied a carbon tax over the past thirty years. A macroeconomic panel data regression model ex-post study was applied by contrasting the obtained results via a robustness check. The estimation results indicate a slightly positive and significant association between the carbon tax and tourism employment, which was additionally tested by considering revenue recycling, early adopters of the carbon tax, and a higher carbon tax compared to countries with a lower carbon tax. We cannot conclude that these factors matter for tourism employment, proving the robustness of the results. Revenue-neutral carbon taxation, policies to address the skills gap, push and pull incentives, and active labour market policies to facilitate the quick re-integration of jobseekers into employment are viewed as pivotal to ensure a smoother transition toward a sustainable tourism labour market. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {The market for socially conscious products and services has grown exponentially in the last years. Consequently, adding social value is among the great challenges that companies have to face nowadays. In view of this, companies need leaders with a set of specific skills that prepares them to act and compete in this new environment. This is especially true for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are even more dependent on their leaders' competences. The aim of this article is to analyse the influence of leaders' sustainability competences on the social entrepreneurial orientation of SMEs of the tourism sector, as well as the influence of this strategy on the firm's performance. The methodology used to validate the measurement scales is exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and the structural equation modelling technique is applied to analyse the causal relationships proposed in the model. The results show that sustainability competences positively affect social entrepreneurial orientation; specifically, the social risk-taking and proactivity competence has a positive influence on the economic and social performance of SMEs, and in particular, on their green innovation performance. These results highlight the key role that leaders' competences have in SMEs' social orientation and thus, the importance of training in competences for sustainable development. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to provide the examples of eco-innovations in agriculture relating to the concept of sustainable development and the indication of their conditions. Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to the research, namely: descriptive statistical and economic analysis of the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data and Statistics Poland data, as well as case studies of organic food producers, covering the years 2005-2019. Indicated information sources, encompassing long time span of analysis and various data collections, allowed presenting the complementary picture of eco-innovations at the sector and farm levels. The research examined the different types of ecological innovations in Polish agriculture, including: (1) organisational innovations with an institutional background (e.g., the organic farming support and greening mechanism of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)-implemented in the family farming sector); and (2) the product, marketing, process and organisational innovations in selected organic farms that were individual farmers' initiatives. On the one hand, the research documented the effectiveness of new agricultural policy solutions in the agricultural sector that are examples of organisational eco-innovations. During 2005-2016, the certification system, as well as policy support, contributed to the development of organic farms in Poland in terms of the growth in the share of this type of holdings in total (from 0.5% to 4.6%) and in the overall utilised agricultural area (UAA) (from 0.3% to 3.7%). Moreover, during 2014-2015, as a result of the greening in agricultural holdings, the area sown with pulses and papilionaceous, i.e., crops improving soil structure and protecting soils, rose by 174% and 161%, respectively. On the other hand, the case studies conducted showed that the food producers' knowledge and skills combined with a favourable local economic and social situation, as well as institutional support, played a key role in the process of the emergence of eco-innovations. Among those factors, the respondents' individual characteristics associated with attitudes towards farming and the social, human and physical capital passed on by family members should be highlighted. This paper contributes to existing literature in two ways. First, this study combines both quantitative and qualitative (including in-depth interviews) approaches to eco-innovations at the micro and macro level of analysis. Second, by differentiating two approaches to ecological innovations, namely the conventional and the sustainable, the article indicates and considers the key factors favourable to the latter. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {There are pressures to adopt sustainable behaviour more so in generating profits and benefiting the society to accelerate green efforts through a green framework. The overarching goal of the paper is premised through various works of literature, building the ecosystem the elements highlighted by most researchers in the field of environmental entrepreneurship. The various models reviewed consists of generic incubators and entrepreneurship, and societal and environmental factors. Environmental entrepreneurship is often used interchangeably with concepts such as green entrepreneurship and ecopreneurship which under-researched globally, with non-existent efforts on the applicability and modelling of key environmental entrepreneurship within a specific context utilising the system dynamics approach. In order to assess the environmental entrepreneurship ecosystem, the authors adopted a system dynamic approach to determine key variables that enable the development of the system. A literature review was conducted, and of the 135 articles reviewed, n=92 peer-reviewed articles met the criteria that the researchers set. Some of the results emanating from a systematic review are environmental policy, green skills, financial and non-financial support, societal and behavioural factors, environmental agility, ethics and governance, and access to markets. The theoretical results are simulated using system dynamics modelling. Due to limited research on the above-mentioned topic, a possible impacting variable (Exogenous variables) was broadened to add value to, and have an impact on, the study. Upon reviewing the above-mentioned models, the framework emerged signalling elements to be simulated in the system dynamics model, which were then theoretically contextualised for the South African context. The theoretical virtual system dynamic model forming part of the framework will be tested and validated in the next study. The applicability of the theoretical ecosystem to South African context as well as future recommendations are provided in the study. © 2021 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A green entrepreneur's enterprise prioritises environmental protection by minimising the negative impact of existing products, services, or processes. It contributes to the beneficial transformation of society. This study discusses green entrepreneur challenges and innovations in Tamil Nadu's Salem District. The intention of this study is to determine what factors determine the obstacles they experience in their business and how to transform those obstacles into opportunities Design/methodology/approach: Snowball sampling is employed to choose the population for this study from Salem's vast population, and the total number of respondents chosen is 50. Findings: Simple Percentage Analysis, Chi-Square, and the Henry Garrett Ranking Method are utilised for measuring the factors. The result of testing the hypothesis indicates that there is no correlation between age and the influence to start a business using technical or professional knowledge and skill Future Implications: Our work presents a range of theoretical and practical implications, as previously said, but it is not without limitations. In order to ascertain the direct and indirect effects of stakeholder demands, green dynamic capacity, green innovation, and firm performance, we first propose that future research make use of our framework and conduct a comparison study of small and large enterprises. © 2022 The authors.},

The data were collected in a Eurobarometer survey, and refer to resource efficiency, green markets, and CE procedures. Lack of environmental expertise is one of the factors that might be perceived as an obstacle when trying to implement resource-efficiency actions. Previous research has shown that, although resource-efficiency practices are adopted by firms in all European countries, there are differences both within and between countries. The analysis of the determinants of green behavior by European SMEs was completed by a study of heterogeneity across firms and within countries with a multilevel latent class model, a hierarchical clustering method. A general important observation is that having no workers dedicated to green jobs is strongly correlated to the probability of adopting resource-efficiency practices, while perceiving the need of extra environmental skills has a positive effect on the intention to implement actions in the future. Other characteristics of the firms play a significant impact on resource efficiency: in general, older and bigger firms, with larger yearly turnover, are more prone to implement actions. © 2021 by the authors.

It pays attention to the effects on the design of new green jobs and the necessary skills to develop this type of new positions generated, with higher labour wellbeing. The paper is focused on the analysis of the green jobs’ opportunity for Europe, at a country level, with a specific analysis made for the Spanish case. A systematisation of the concepts and calculations on the issue is made and analysed (attending the international institutions and forums proposals) to harmonise the recovery plans, apply them beyond the energy sector to other related green activities and align the public and private sector, and other critical stakeholders, in achieving this goal. The following research questions were formulated: (1) what is the estimated number of new green jobs that would be created as a consequence of the implementation of the Recovery Plan in Spain; (2) which new soft skills or re-skilling would be necessary to develop such new green jobs; (3) how much are the new jobs aligned with wellbeing economics? The research was conducted by applying a few research methods, i.e., secondary sources, the desk research method and the exploration method, critical and comparative analysis, inductive and deductive reasoning and some mathematical calculations. The research contribution can provide a valuable source of information to coordinate sectoral plans by the policymakers, particularly those responsible for the economy, business, green activities and education. © 2021 by the authors.},

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of research undertaken by the Next Tourism Generation Alliance (NTGA) project in Wales evidencing sustainability skills gaps. Survey data collected from five tourism sectors, accommodation, food and beverage, destination management, visitor attractions, travel agents and tour operators, show that the highest green and social skills gaps were identified in food and beverage businesses, whilst accommodation reported the lowest skills gaps. The effect of the type of tourism sector, business size and job level on green skills gaps perceptions was found to be insignificant, which indicates that training in sustainability skills is considered important regardless of these variables. The effect of type of tourism activity on perceptions of social skills gaps including personal and communication was significant. Addressing skills gaps is crucial given the significance of the industry in the national economy and the need for recovery from COVID‐19. Tourism is one of the worst affected industries in the pandemic, and global market research and policy guidance highlight the importance of sustainable tourism development to ensure a resilient recovery. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet little research provides evidence of the effectiveness of a green stimulus. We begin by summarizing recent research on the effectiveness of the green portion of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment growth. Green investments are most effective in communities whose workers have the appropriate “green” skills. We then provide new evidence on the skills requirements of both green and brown occupations, as well as from occupations at risk of job losses due to COVID-19, to illustrate which workers are most likely to benefit from a pandemic-related green stimulus. We find similarities between some energy sector workers and green jobs, but a poor match between green jobs and occupations at risk due to COVID-19. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence on the potential for job training programs to help ease the transition to a green economy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The eco-innovation is regarding as one of the important sources of this transition, however, the rate of adaptation of renewable energy remains uncomfortably low. The ambiguity still exists whether eco-innovation increases or decreases energy consumptions in both aggregate and disaggregate level. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of eco-innovation along with human capital, and trade openness on energy consumption at the aggregate (total) and disaggregate levels (renewable and non-renewable). For the above-mentioned objective, this study selects OECD countries' datasets between 1990 and 2017. The empirical investigation carries out using econometric techniques such as augmented mean group (AMG) and cross-section autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL). The outcomes confirm that eco-innovation, human capital, and energy price play positive roles in increasing the consumption of renewable energy in the OECD region. In contrast, economic growth and trade openness still promote non-renewable energy consumption in this region. It is suggested that eco-innovation and high- skilled human capital growth be promoted to enhance the ratio of renewable energy consumption. This study further indicates that a sustainable environment could promote green growth through clean energy production and consumption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic presents multiple challenges for sustainable development, particularly for female entrepreneurship in the renewable segment. Solar energy is the most prospective segment of renewable energy resources. The share of global female inventors in energy technologies is less than 30%. This article is devoted to prospects of the development of female entrepreneurship in the solar energy market. We analyzed the global impact of the pandemic on the solar energy markets, and assessed the prospects for their development in the post-pandemic period. We used data from leading international analytical agencies, such as IAE and Bloomberg for 2000-2020. We also used results of international case study analyses of the International Energy Agency from 2019 on female entrepreneurship in solar energy. In addition, we investigated the Russian-French case study of female entrepreneurship in the solar energy segment. Based on the results of the analysis, we concluded that the solar energy sector will continue to develop in the future. According to the research results, negative pandemic trends, such as the reduction in the number of commissioned projects and investments in the solar power industry persist in the short term. So far, the pandemic has not had a significant negative impact on the strategic and long-term period, and female entrepreneurship will continue to evolve. We argue that it is important to minimize financial barriers currently existing in special funding and grant programs for supporting this trend and increasing the number of women in solar energy entrepreneurship. It is crucial to focus future financial programs for female entrepreneurs in the solar energy sector on rural regions as they are more prospective in terms of solar energy development. In addition, a range of educational programs in soft skills should be developed to strengthen engineering specialists’ background in business and negotiations. The research results can be used in future research in the field of sustainable development, renewables, and female employment in the renewable and solar energy sector. © 2021, Institute of Economic Sciences.

By conducting a cross-lagged analysis of more than 370 European B Corps—a growing form of social enterprise, this paper investigates how firm CSP is impacted by the regulatory framework, the technological capacity, and the demand pressures of the country in which it is embedded. Our findings support that the presence of technological and innovation capacities and of demanding, conscious customers are the two most important country-level factors impacting CSP.

The enormous investment required to achieve these goals is expected to have wide ranging economic benefits. For example, the move toward a green economy will create a large number of new jobs and provide additional economic stimulus through on-going development. This study employs the input-output method in conjunction with questionnaire surveys to elucidate these effects. The sectors that are expected to see the greatest economic benefits include iron/steel/miscellaneous metals, electrical equipment and mechanical equipment. The accumulated economic output is expected to increase by 5.89 trillion NTD; meanwhile, employment in renewable electricity sectors is expected to increase by 142 thousand jobs. Note that 51.90% of the job increment will be for professionals and technical specialists. At present, the cultivation of special skills is dependent on in-house training. Industrial parks specializing in renewable energy should be established to promote the exchange of talent and technological innovations. In the manufacturing sector, 55.55% will be for craft related workers and elementary labourers. These changes will necessitate a reorganization of the workforce through government-academia-industry cooperation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cement is a fundamental building and construction material for societies around the world. However, its manufacturing process is exceptionally energy intensive and has a substantial contribution to the man-made global warming potential which calls for immediate reduction. In this context, the implementation of green production practices and technologies in the Indian cement sector is of particular interest and global impact given that the country is the second biggest producer worldwide. Furthermore, the literature reveals that although the implementation of green practices in the cement manufacturing sector faces barriers across a variety of aspects, there is only limited research focussing on developing countries. This research covers this gap by concentrating on the barriers encountered by the cement sector of India and proposes strategies for their alleviation based on input from five experts and the use of the multi-criteria decision making method (MCDM) best–worst method (BWM). The results show that the lack of conducive corporate environment is the most important barrier, inadequate skills and attitudes are the second, while capital-related limitations come third. The experts highlight the need for mechanisms promoting cost effective environmental research and training as well as appropriate funding instruments and procurement rules from the government. Furthermore, a clear vision and plan from the management’s part are fundamental for the effective incorporation of green practices in the organisational identity and the required employee engagement. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to assess the factors favoring the adoption of the challenges faced and support mechanism, which will lead to the proliferation of glass fiber-reinforced gypsum (GFRG) technology in India. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews with 35 experts, including construction developers, architects, contractors, government officials and design consultants, were conducted. This qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis and matrix analysis. Findings: GFRG-based buildings produce much less carbon footprints as compared to traditional ones and can be safely recommended as a promising, environmentally sensitive technology of the future. The major drivers in its adoption are its efficient construction capability, energy and soil conservation and significant waste reduction. Some of the challenges in implementation are long planning time, lack of skilled labor, lack of awareness about green building technologies and myopic perception of high cost incurred in green building adoption in people’s minds. Practical implications: This study establishes that the construction industry has the potential to contribute toward creating a sustainable and green planet. It does so by evaluating and then positively positioning GFRG as an environmentally friendly building system. Originality/value: The harmful effects of continuous environmental manipulation by humans leading to its degradation is a critical discussion agenda for most nations of the world. The issue has been taken up seriously by developing countries, and now, developing countries are also becoming sensitised to it. Several policies toward the attainment of this goal have been formulated and are being implemented by government and private bodies. Although some authors have studied the issues and challenges related to the adoption of green buildings, their attempts mostly focused on developed countries. Moreover, research that investigated the evaluation of the GFRG building system as a successful green technology of the future is inadequate. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Blended finance offers a way of increasing total expenditure on tackling the twin climate and biodiversity global emergencies. However, this requires effective methods for combining private and public funding. As an example of the barriers and opportunities facing practical implementation of a blended finance approach, this Viewpoint paper presents a case-study of the UK Peatland Code which will have relevance to other instances of blended finance initiatives elsewhere. Restoration of degraded peatlands reduces their carbon emissions and can provide emission reductions and other environmental gains in a socially cost-effective manner. However, many benefits are public goods arising as externalities which are difficult to convert into financial returns to private investors. To address this problem, the Peatland Code has been developed as a voluntary certification standard for UK peatland projects wishing to seek additional private funding via the voluntary carbon market. However, uptake of the Peatland Code has been slow. Despite growing demand in the voluntary carbon market, we observe six main barriers to supply-side uptake: lack of awareness amongst land managers; resistance to land use change, particularly when measures are seen to potentially compromise agricultural production; high upfront capital costs; limited equipment and skills; uncertainty over ongoing costs and support; and, administrative bureaucracy/inflexibility. We offer recommendations for how such barriers could be reduced to increase supply-side uptake, including: increased effort to promote sustainable land management and blended financing of it, and restoration activities and the Peatland Code in particular; continued public funding of upfront capital investments, with private funding directed more at ongoing payments; and, simplified and more flexible administrative arrangements, with public and private schemes designed in tandem to improve their practical complementarity. © 2021},

The results reveal serious gaps in green skills among tourism employees in Bulgaria, which need to be addressed by relevant and regular training. A comparison of the five tourism subsectors show that representatives from the food and beverage (F&B) subsector have a completely different attitude about green skills related to current and future needs. Still, the tourism subsector type was not shown to influence the absolute gaps between the current and required future skills level.

This study aims to improve the sustainable performance of manufacturing firms in Pakistan through innovation capabilities and green process innovation. The study has adopted a quantitative approach, and data has been accumulated through a structured questionnaire distributed among 299 employees working in manufacturing firms. A structural equation model using Smart PLS software was used to analyze the collected data from the respondents. The results have identified a significant correlation between innovation capabilities, green process innovation, and sustainable performance. The buffering role of digital leadership enhances the employees’ creative skills and sustainable performance. Additionally, the extent that green product innovation plays a mediating role between innovation capabilities, green process innovation, and sustainable performance has been contemplated. Henceforth, the current study also analyzes the moderating role of digital leadership in sustainable performance. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The present paper extends the evolutionary economic geography framework by focussing on digital literacy. Specifically, we argue that workforce skills associated with the use and development of ICT technologies are an important, if understudied, determinant of regional diversification into new green technologies. Accordingly, we analyse their relationships with relatedness and green diversification using panel data on 142 European regions for the period 2006 – 2013. We find that e-skills endowment is a positive predictor of regions’ ability to specialise in new technological domains, and especially for green specializations. Further, e-skills negatively moderate the effect of relatedness on technological diversification. These results call attention to the potential of digitalisation in the context of the transition towards a greener economy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, this study seeks to identify the readiness level technology competency of green skills in 4IR amongst TVET teacher trainee. This study will also identify the needed level technology competency of green skills in 4IR towards TVET teacher trainee from the perspective of educator. A total of 154 teacher trainees and 44 educators were selected as samples by using disproportionate stratified random technique. The questionnaire has been developed and adapted from the Model of Green Skills Competency by Pavlova and Skills in 4IR consists of 8 indicators. Mean score and standard deviation for statistical measurement were used to report the findings. Findings from the analysis show that the readiness level technology competency of green skill in 4IR amongst TVET teacher trainee are at a moderate level. However, the needed level technology competency of green skills in 4IR towards TVET teacher trainee from the perspective of educator are at high level. This shows that technology competency of green skills is important to teacher trainee in order to face the challenge of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Findings from this study will benefit Institute of Teacher Education and Ministry of Education in order to prepare teacher trainees as well as in-service teachers with technology green skills so that our Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved and equip themselves in a way of Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Thus, the purpose of the study is to explore how instruments used by the nongovernmental organizations are applied for environmental security and sustainable development in Ethiopia. It addresses issues of how environmental education in context is working to instill the knowledge, skills, awareness, and attitudes of the stakeholders. Recent discussions of the African Union Summit 2020, Africa Agenda 2063, Davos 2020 World Economic Forum, United Nations Agenda 2030, and the Green Economy Strategy in Ethiopia have strongly sought to strengthen environmental education as an instrument of global and local sustainability of the environment and development. Here, the study collected pieces of evidence from environmental programs of a nongovernmental organization in Ethiopia. The study focused on a nonformal environmental education, based on the frameworks of the agreements and declarations where Ethiopia is a contracting party. The frameworks are guiding concepts to investigate the phenomenon. Methods. The study used a thematic analysis based on empirical studies. Specifically, empirical studies from primary and secondary sources on the implementation of environment and forest development programs of the organization are crucial to providing a concrete presentation. Results. Empirical pieces of evidence show that the organization plans, projects, and performance reports were found inconsistent with the frameworks of international agreements and national policy. The empirical study also shows that environmental education is not well considered and institutionalized in the organization's project planning. Environmental education strategies are not explicitly visible while planning the projects. Moreover, in some implementation strategies of the organization, there was inconsistency in using environmental education as a strategic instrument to improve environmental security and quality. Conclusion. The organization's environmental performance was deep-rooted to improve the status quo in the living community. However, the utilization of environmental education was discovered to be minimal. Thus, stakeholders and the organization take the advice to integrate into the entire cycle of the project.  © 2021 Mekonnen Hailemariam Zikargae.},

Our study aims to understand how the future of work could result in conditions, which contribute to vulnerability for different groups of workers. Methods: A horizon scan was conducted to systematically identify and synthesize diverse sources of evidence, including academic and gray literature and resources shared over social media. Evidence was synthesized, and trend categories were developed through iterative discussions among the research team. Results: Nine trend categories were uncovered, which included the digital transformation of the economy, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning-enhanced automation, AI-enabled human resource management systems, skill requirements for the future of work; globalization 4.0, climate change and the green economy, Gen Zs and the work environment; populism and the future of work, and external shocks to accelerate the changing nature of work. The scan highlighted that some groups of workers may be more likely to experience conditions that contribute to vulnerability, including greater exposure to job displacement or wage depression. The future of work could also create opportunities for labor market engagement. Conclusion: The future of work represents an emerging public health concern. Exclusion from the future of work has the potential to widen existing social and health inequities. Thus, tailored supports that are resilient to changes in the nature and availability of work are required for workers facing vulnerability. © 2021 The Authors.

Findings: The findings indicate that energy management and waste management practices have significant effects on the health and safety performance of the construction projects, while storm-water management has no effect. Practical implications: Project and site managers need to take into consideration the skill set of their workforce when attempting to adopt new innovative construction strategies the workers are unfamiliar with in a changing construction environment. There is also a need for more training of workers on generic and specific green skills to avoid health and safety challenges on site. Originality/value: The findings of this study make significant contribution to the debate on the health and safety performance of green projects, as only a few studies have been conducted on this topic.

Hence, to address the research gap, this study follows the steps proposed by Tranfield et al. (2003). The major part of the study comprises descriptive analysis and thematic analysis. Descriptive analysis of the selected 66 articles was examined with the classification framework, which contains year-wise distribution, journal-wise distribution, the focus of the concept, the economic sector, and dimensions of sustainable development. The paper conducts a thematic analysis of the following research questions. What are the green competencies and their conceptual definition? What are their dimensions? Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies a systematic literature review of green competencies literature, extends the state-of-the-art using the natural resource-based view, and discusses future research directions for academicians and practitioners. Findings: In recent years, there was considerable interest in green competencies (GC), as reflected in the surge of articles published in this genre. This paper asserts that green competencies are a multidimensional construct comprised of green knowledge, green skills, green abilities, green attitudes, green behaviours, and green awareness. Originality/value: Despite the significance of green competencies, there has been a dearth of study to define the constructs and identify the dimensions. Hence, this study addresses the literature gap by conceptualisation and discusses dimensions of the construct. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Additionally, the results show that energy taxes have an indirect effect on human capital through their impact on polluting emissions. The taxes on energy products are able to reduce both the flux and the stock of polluting emissions that have a negative impact on human capital skills in the short and long term.

This article is intended to obtain the consensus of a panel of experts on the content analysis of the GS module. Modified Delphi Technique was used to analyse the contents of the GS Modules. Nine experts in the curriculum, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Environmental Education as well as DT excellent teachers were selected through the method of purposive sampling. The data were collected using a semi-structural interview method for the first round and questionnaires for the second round. Based on the findings, two elements, namely knowledge and practice of green skills included in the GS module, are analysed using IBM SPSS version 21 to get the value of ‘Inter Quartile Range’ (IQR) and the Wilcoxon Test. The findings show that all the items for practice have been agreed upon by the experts while two items of knowledge have been rejected.

Meanwhile the sample technique used is disproportionate stratified random sampling method and the sample size is 144. Findings show that networking and reflection were found to be positively related to learning for sustainable development, while teaching strategy was not significantly related to learning for sustainable development. The indicator of model was observed to be sufficiently solid and flexible to incorporate and measure the four construct which are cognitive, technology, emotional intelligence and action competency. Finally, the results show that networking indicator have the strongest relationship to learning for sustainable development in order to develop green skills competency in industrial 4.0 amongst TVET teacher trainee. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

Applying the systematic review methodology, this review involves 134 journal articles published from 2006 to 2020. Using a thematic analysis, this review finds five main topics for manufacturing research: (i) eco-design and engineering, (ii) firm characteristics and performance, (iii) decision-making behaviour and options, (iv) industrial trends and indicators, and (v) energy intensity and efficiency. Eight main targets also serve as eco-innovation strategies for manufacturing practice: (i) industrial clusters and collaborations strategy, (ii) eco-engineering standards and skills strategy, (iii) green knowledge sharing and sourcing strategy, (iv) energy pricing and costing strategy, (v) innovation incentives and investments strategy, (vi) environmental regulations and protection strategy, (vii) energy structures and systems strategy, (viii) competitive and creative design strategy. Guided by these findings and an awareness of internal, external, and bilateral factors, this review proposes a multi-level strategic framework identifying design, organisational, and regional networks as central to the management of manufacturing eco-innovation. Additionally, premised on network and symbiotic framings for manufacturing eco-innovation, this article sets an agenda for future eco-innovation research involving manufacturing firms. © 2021 The Authors},

Findings indicate that efforts toward adaptation were limited to disaster preparedness for hurricanes, reflecting a short-term focus in the face of climate change uncertainties. In addition to the lack of finances and knowledge for incorporating adaptation measures, their capacity to adapt is diminished due to a lack of access to climate change information, skilled staff, and specific climate change planning reflecting limited human and institutional capitals.

	abstract = {Abstract: Small and medium enterprises cannot achieve environmental sustainability goals in isolation. They need to acquire capabilities to perform within networks of professional and social relations with other organizations. However, network relationships are often insufficient due to lack of sustainability in network capability. This multidimensional concept involves four components: coordination, relational skills, partner knowledge, and internal communication. This study proposes a new dimension related to the collaborative environmental relationship. This component addresses an enterprise’s ability to enhance environmental collaboration, share knowledge, and increase environmental awareness. This study, therefore, suggests testing and comparing the five-dimensional scale of network capability with the existing four-dimensional scale, and examining its impact on eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance. This has not been tested previously. Using partial least squares path modelling, this study tests a set of hypothesised relationships that focus on a sample of 237 Tunisian enterprises. The findings reveal that: (1) the sample supports measurement properties of the updated network capability and indicates that the new dimension in network capability research and sustainable development is important and can be added to the finalised network capability construct, (2) network capability, with the updated five dimensions, directly and positively influences eco-innovation capability and sustainable performance, and the impacts are more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct, and (3) eco-innovation mediates the relationship between network capability with the updated five dimensions and enterprises’ sustainable performance, and the impact is more effective than in the previous four-dimensional construct. Therefore, our study will help strengthen the enterprise’s performance in promoting sustainable development.

	abstract = {Green innovation has become a norm and crucial element of success for modern firms. Manufacturing firms come up with alternative ideas to achieve green innovation. This study proposes that green innovation can be enhanced by amalgamating green business strategies and mastering green competencies within a firm. It isolates itself from previous research by focusing on inherent internal competencies, which could bolster green innovation performance. This integration not only helps firms achieve green innovation but could also improve green value co-creation. Meanwhile, green value co-creation will also mediate the relationship between integrated competencies and green innovation. Data has been collected from the managers of original equipment manufacturers within Pakistan via survey. A total of 319 responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling, and empirical results support the proposed hypotheses. The study’s findings suggest that green competencies coupled with green business strategy positively influence green value co-creation and green innovation. Moreover, green value co-creation elevates firms’ green performance and help firms to achieve green innovation. Consequently, theoretical and managerial implications are presented, which adds to this study’s significance under the dynamic capability view. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, little is known regarding what can reshape their attitude towards environmental management and uplift their abilities to counter environmental issues. Based on the extant literature review, we suggest that small business firms necessitate direction, motivation, structural capabilities, and ingenuity to tackle environmental issues through green innovation. We postulate that green organizational and human resource factors such as green business strategy (direction), green competencies (structural capabilities), green organizational culture (impetus), and green absorptive capacity (ingenuity) can reshape small businesses firms' tendency towards environmental preservation and green innovation. We tested our hypotheses on the data collected from small manufacturing firms located in different regions of Pakistan. Our findings suggest that developing countries' small business firms lag in environmental preservation due to their inability to comprehend and handle environmental problems. Introducing relevant green organizational and human resource factors can significantly improve small business firms' attitudes towards environmental management and green innovation. Moreover, our findings also reveal that small business firms lean towards green process innovation rather than green product innovation, depicting small business firms' behavioural tendencies towards innovation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Showing keen interest to skills and the occupation requirements of green environment, the green evolution mostly affects existing and emerging new occupations. The occupational profiles globally will change and demand for the most part new and different skills, because green skills demand already poses a major barrier to transitions to green environment, economies and green job creation. The purpose of this study was to explore essential generic green skills for green jobs in the field of electrical/electronics. A qualitative design was the main means of data collection and Nvivo was used to transcribe and analyse the data. The participants targeted for this research were (6) lecturers from the Department of Technical Education, School of Vocational and Technical Education, Adamawa State College of Education, Hong, Nigeria, lecturers from Adamawa State Polytechnic, lecturers from Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola and (6) staff of Power Holding Company of Nigeria, Northeast Zone, Gombe office, Nigeria. (3) Renewable energy Firm in Gombe, Gombe Sate. The findings of this study have revealed that the essential generic green skills are; Technical skills, renewable energy, communication skills, intellectual, core-worker relationship, and generally be physically fit. It is envisaged that this study will benefit a large number of professionals more especially those in the field of electrical engineering, green jobs and those in the green economy sector. More study needs to be carried in this area to further explore the essential generic skills. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.

	abstract = {The green hydrogen economy offers synthetic green energy with significant impacts and is environmentally friendly compared to current fossil-based fuels. Exploration of green hydrogen energy in Southern Africa is still in the initial stages in many low-resourced settings aiming to benefit from sustainable green energy. At this early stage, potential benefits to society are yet to be understood. That is why the socio-economic impact of green hydrogen energy must be explored. This paper reviews the current literatures to describe the potential socio-economic effects in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The review supports the view that green hydrogen will be beneficial and have great potential to revolutionise agricultural and industrial sectors, with advanced sustainable changes for both production and processing. This paper also examines how sustainable green hydrogen energy production in Southern Africa will provide economic value in the energy export sector around the world and support climate change initiatives. Further, it discusses the impacts of the green hydrogen value addition chain and the creation of green jobs, as well as the need for corresponding investments and policy reforms. It is also noted that the green hydrogen economy can contribute to job losses in fossil fuel-based industries, so that the workforce there may need re-skilling to take up green jobs. Such exchanges may deter efforts towards poverty alleviation and economic growth in SADC © 2022, Journal of Energy in Southern Africa.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The utilisation of market-based approaches (MBAs) than command-control approaches (CCAs) is still at the embryonic stage to stimulate the green behaviour of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. The study aims to elucidate the association between environmental incentives (EIs), green responsiveness (GR) and environmental performance (EP). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative dominant research design is adopted with qualitative support. The study model is developed by integrating legitimacy theory (LT) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV). The cross-sectional data were gathered from the upper echelon of 395 SMEs in Sri Lanka, and 10 subsequent interviews were conducted. The partial least squares approach of structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to evaluate the hypothesised relationships. Findings: The results found evidence to demonstrate that EIs positively link with GR and EP and GR mediates this association. Further, the study revealed that although MBAs are established, the SME sector is less aware of EIs such as tax concessions, tax reliefs, low interest, soft loans and discounts on eco-materials. Practical implications: The results provide valuable insights to enhance environmental sustainability. The owners of SMEs should strategically use environmental inducements to overcome resource poverty to engage in green practices. The regulators and policymakers should develop the incentive policies and provide the mechanisms to disseminate the required skills and technologies to SMEs. Originality/value: According to the authors' best knowledge, this is one of the pioneering empirical studies on EIs, GR and EP with mediating effects in Sri Lanka. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius are compared to Toyota Corolla. The parameters considered are initial cost, maintenance cost (spare parts and labour), fuel cost, and availability of skilled labour. Considering Ghana's energy mix, a conventional vehicle will emit 3.35 times more CO2 emissions compared with an electric vehicle. The results show that while there are 30% savings on cost per mile for Toyota Prius it cost at least 13.5% more to own an electric vehicle compared to Toyota Corolla. The Ghana government's tax incentive for removing import levy will only reduce the cost per mile by 2.5%. Ghana's energy surplus of 98.59 GWh is enough to charge at least 1.5 million electric vehicles. But a huge skills gap in electric vehicle maintenance, non-availability of spare parts, charging infrastructure and the initial price of electric cars are the main challenges to overcome to boost electric vehicle penetration in Ghana and other countries in Africa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Firms that provide green skills to their employees are touted to respond quickly to green policies and develop the capabilities to implement superior strategies to mitigate climate change. This study seeks to explore the mechanisms used by manufacturing firms to promote green skills among their employees. A case study approach using semi-structured interviews was deployed to explore these mechanisms in six large chemical manufacturing firms. The results indicate that collective effort, self-realisation and continuous awareness were the three main mechanisms used by firms to promote green skills among their employees. Firms actively engage employees from every level of management together to upgrade their skills. Pay raise and promotion are used as an incentive by firms to encourage the employees to obtain green skills. This study proposes a green skills development mechanism for policy makers and managers to nurture and invigorate green skills among employees. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Studies on green behaviour have produced a plethora of noteworthy discoveries, whether focused on financial success, individual capabilities, or development. However, despite significant growth in interest in green business practices, the relationship between individuals’ willingness and green competencies has received little attention. This article used the customised green competencies conceptual model to investigate how green skills influence organisational performance and their relationship with the willingness moment. This article developed an innovative human resource management approach to address these difficulties. A questionnaire was used to perform empirical statistical research with 516 respondents from Serbian universities. Different mathematical and statistical methodologies were used to analyse the results. The findings corroborate the suggested theoretical model, and they suggest that green competencies will influence people’s willingness to participate in green activities. This article gives new information on human behaviour and organisational effectiveness in a green atmosphere. It includes managerial and practical consequences and recommendations for businesses looking to improve their social responsibility and environmental sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

This exploratory paper aims to prioritize key practices as “criteria” for food supply chains that lead to food waste reduction to ensure green waste management. Twenty-five criteria from the existing literature and expert inputs were assessed to resolve food waste reduction issues in food supply chains, especially in the agricultural sectors. The study identifies and ranks the intensities of each of the listed criteria. In the study, the Best-Worst Method, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is applied. According to the findings, waste prevention at the earlier stages of food supply chains is given more priority compared to food waste minimization and treatment at the later stages. Hence, the study concludes “skill and training” as the highest ranked criteria, followed by “protection and infrastructure.” Further, the study infers that understanding the individual intensities of criteria within a food supply chain can affect waste generation at each level, having a significant impact on waste reduction.

Thus, this study focuses on the relationship between VC and the green innovation of environmentally friendly firms. The analysis combines traditional patent data with homogenous citation data to jointly examine the quantity and quality of VC-funded firms' green innovation. Results suggest that VC support not only improves firms' success rate of patent application but also increases the innovation “value” represented by increased citation. The Chinese government has asked government VC (GVC) to be a long-term strategic investment for environmentally friendly firms. However, we found that GVC negatively affects green innovation, which may be caused by the risk aversion and adverse selection of the GVC manager. By comparing the roles of experienced foreign VC and full-sample VC, we confirmed that the investment skills of developed countries could enhance the quantity and quality of green innovation in China. © 2021},

The green economy is a priority field for developing and developed economies. However, as the authors of the publication have realised, there is no consensus about the meaning of the green economy and "green"jobs, that is why an uncertainty as in measurement of economic trends and an impact of it, as well as in what skills and competencies should be assigned to the "green"ones, arises. The new "green"processes and technologies are arising in a progressive trend, that is why it is important to ensure there are properly skilled candidates with appropriate "green"skills and competencies on the labour market, as well as to prepare fresh graduates with the "green"skills that will meet requirement of both, the recent and the future companies, especially operating in the "green"sector. In the framework of "SB Bridge"project an online survey was conducted by interviewing the "green"companies to identify which skills and competencies are needed for "green"jobs recently, and whether candidates and fresh graduates are enough with the "green"skills and competencies for fruitful engagement to "green"jobs. As the survey identified, fresh graduates and candidates for "green"jobs lack technical and (or) mechanical knowledge, IT skills, as well as experience and ability to work independently and in the team to resolve arising problems.  © 2021 Jelena Nikolajenko-Skarbalė et al., published by Sciendo.},

This study undertakes a contextualised review of diverse knowledge domains to identify the key features of enterprise support for pro-environmental SMEs. In doing so, the paper plots the knowledge journey of experienced academic programme providers, from the initial design of an enterprise support programme for pro-environmental SMEs, through a thematic review of academic, grey and other related literature and finally presents a propositional and normative conceptual framework that proposes eight key features of enterprise support for pro-environmental SMEs. The resulting ‘framework for action’ aims to offer a practical tool for providers of pro-environmental enterprise support to review and improve their own provision, an analytical frame for other researchers in this field and a benchmark for SMEs seeking guidance on their pathway to net-zero business performance. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development is an effort to balance social progress with environmental equilibrium and economic growth. Young people affected by forced displacement are particularly vulnerable to the economic, environmental and social challenges of their surroundings. Using a framework that centres sustainable development on these three interconnected pillars, this article explores how the economic and environmental contexts in Lebanon impact adolescents’ and youth social development, drawing on qualitative data from adolescents in refugee and host community settings. The article highlights that adolescents face economic challenges because of the national economic crisis, exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdowns and service closures, poor labour market opportunities for youth—and for refugees in particular—and rising living costs. The environmental challenges facing adolescents include inadequate shelter (especially in collective shelters and informal tented shelters) and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. These economic and environmental conditions in turn influence adolescents’ social capabilities such as their physical and mental health, and voice and agency. The article concludes by highlighting the need for a more integrated approach to sustainable development that will allow both present and future generations in Lebanon to meet their own needs and live empowered lives. It outlines measures that could help achieve this approach, including: creating policies and programmes that promote investment in technical and soft skills-building to equip young people with the skills they need to take up jobs within the green economy; investing in adolescent-friendly social protection with linkages to environmental projects; and improved shelter, health and WASH facilities, particularly in response to the ongoing and future impacts of climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

By this we mean the potential of an occupation to be able to perform green tasks on the basis of the skills attributed to it, whereby it is irrelevant whether the occupation already bundles green tasks or not. The results show that occupations with a high green potential are predominantly those with an engineering and technical background. In order to substantiate our green potential measure, we provide evidence of a positive association between demand of employment in occupations with high green potential and an increase in the implicit tax rate on greenhouse gas emissions. The share of employment in occupations with a green potential above a reasonable threshold in the total Swiss labour force is 16.7% (number of persons employed) and 18.8% (full-time equivalents). These employed persons are, on average, younger, more often men, have a higher level of educational attainment and a higher probability of having immigrated than employed persons in occupations with low green potential. © 2021, The Author(s).},

However, it appears that there has been a lack of research especially in the building construction sector with respect to green buildings in Nigeria. The main purpose of this research paper is to identify factors should be included in the greening of building construction trade curriculum of technical colleges in north western Nigeria with a view to improving teaching and learning green skills for sustainable development. In this study, simple random sampling was used to select 15 building construction teachers in the north western Nigerian technical colleges. Data for this study were collected using qualitative approach (that is interview). Respondents were requested to answer the interview questions based on the topic under study. The factors (data) identified from the perception of the respondents were collected and analysed by qualitative means based on their level of consideration with regards to improving teaching and learning green skills for sustainable development. In doing so, the data were analysed by transcription, coding, content analysis and thematic with the aid of Nvivo statistical software. Findings indicated that the three main factors that could be included in the integration of green skills into the curriculum of building construction trade include environmental, economic and social factors. Specifically, these factors were disintegrated into climate change, global warming, greenhouse gas emission, economic instability, health and safety issues related to buildings, waste and energy in buildings. This research forms the initial investigation of a more in-depth study of the green skills integration into the Nigerian education curriculum, which aims to achieving environmental, economic and social sustainability. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

The present paper is both descriptive and prescriptive. Firstly, it aims to explore the main barriers, challenges, opportunities, and the context within agro-biomass and agro-industrial waste valorization can accelerate a low carbon economy, in the Thessaly region of Greece, where agricultural production and agro-industrial business are the prevailing economic sectors. Secondly, organizational, societal, knowledge and skills capacity actions are suggested as the most likely to change the business-as usual scenarios. A SWOT analysis performed to draw useful conclusions about the extent to which CWBE principles can be integrated into the economic, social, and environmental life of the Thessaly region, and recommendations made of what it is needed. One of the key insights is how to leverage emerging low carbon circular economy for regional regenerative future. The results showed that waste is managed inefficiently in the region and there is a lack of synergies and collaborations between different stakeholders. The milestones of accelerating a low carbon CWBE for regional development, and employment are a) the territorial cohesion and regional symbiosis, b) increasing the financial market opportunities for small and critical projects, c) promoting awareness, public knowledge, skills, and the responsibility of young scientists and citizens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This study provides an overview of the status of LFGE in RSA and identifies major factors that inhibit the adoption and utilization of this technology, using existing data from 2010–2020 from electronic databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, Google Scholar, Sage Open, Springer Link, Sabinet, and IEEE Xplore, and using a combination of keywords and Boolean functions. This study revealed that, although RSA has made significant progress in the adoption and utilization of landfill gas (LFG) through the seventeen (17) planned LFGE projects, only six (6) are operational and generate 15 MW of electricity supplied to the local grid in the KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, and Gauteng Province. The waste-to-energy (WtE) sources such as LFGE are not given priority, and the country continues to invest in coal-fired power stations, owing to the abundance, availability, and low cost of coal reserves, which will supply coal for the next 200 years. The study identified factors inhibiting LGFE projects in RSA, which included the lack of sanitary landfill sites, LFG monitoring, funding, skills, research, and development. Potential LFGE in RSA is evident, however, except for limited processing facilities, economic investment, and public awareness. Suggestions for further research on the techno-economic and policy assessments are provided in the study. This study contributes to synthesizing evidence of the status of LFGE, insights on state-of-the-art technologies of WtE and the associated challenges in the waste management sector, identifying the potential for LFGE, and LFGE in the circular economy, and building a foundation for future research on WtE such as LFGE. Moreover, it also offers a reference for policymakers, decision-makers, researchers in the waste management sector on the technologies of WtE, LFGE, and potential to reduce waste generated. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Based on the idea that environmental sustainability requires dynamic capabilities, we define dynamic green capability as the ability to build complementary green competences and reconfigure organizationally embedded resources to pursue competitive advantage in a rapidly changing stakeholder environment. We argue that MNEs with greater global connectedness in terms of international diversification or international environmental certification possess knowledge advantages in cultivating dynamic green capabilities. We extend the sensing–seizing–reconfiguring framework and propose that global connectedness substitutes for sensing as a driver of seizing by providing direct access to relevant green knowledge pools around the world, and that it complements seizing as a driver of reconfiguring by strengthening the knowledge routines needed to integrate green competences. © 2019, Academy of International Business.},

Nevertheless, many TVET institutions have not yet embedded green skill elements into the programme’s curriculum because it is still unclear concerning the types of green skills demanded by the green industry. Therefore, this research was conducted to identify the green skills that should be integrated into TVET curricula from the perspective of engineering lecturers in Polytechnics. The nature of this research was descriptive in which the date were collected using self-developed questionnaire. Four Polytechnics located in the East Coast, Northern, Central, and Southern of Malaysia were involved. A total of 332 engineering lecturers from three departments of engineering (Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering) were invited to participate in this research. The findings revealed that the TVET curricular should contains some of these green skills: problem solving skill related to environmental pollution, interpretative skill on environmental phenomena, research skill on environmental issues, data collection skill, analytical skill, exploitation skill on green technology, management skill on natural resources, design skill, controlling skill on environment pollution, raw material management skill, energy saving skill, recycling skill, and reuse skill. It is suggested that Polytechnics should embed these green skills into their programme curricula in order to produce graduates who are able to meet the needs of green industry. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

This article examines the environmental effects of human capital in the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa—over the period 1990–2017. Environmental quality (deploying carbon emissions as the proxy) and environmental sustainability (utilising adjusted net savings, excluding particulate emission damage as the indicator) are identified as the dependent variables. This paper uses more recently developed econometric models, namely the Cross-sectionally Augmented Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) method and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality technique to analyse the data. The findings demonstrate that human capital is significantly positively related to both environmental quality and environmental sustainability in both the short and long run. Human capital also forms a bi-directional causality relationship with environmental sustainability, and environmental quality also causes human capital (thereby showing a uni-directional causality). As such, the paper suggests that governments should develop a policy which promotes investments in greening human skills. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The paper presents some results emerging from the EC funded INNOVEAS project, particularly from a study on the non-economic factors that prevent (or facilitate) the adoption of energy efficiency measures and energy audits by SMEs. This study and its results are relevant for a reflection on the role of SMEs for the adoption of new business practices and technologies (including materials) that are conducive to a green transition. Attention will be paid also to those obstacles and facilitating factors that are relevant for the promotion of the circular economy - which is also, in fact, a strategy for achieving energy efficiency. The paper is based on the view that materials are a special type of technology and, as such, are the result of a social construction process. From this angle, materials can be thought of also by considering the actors involved in the process of their development and use. The life cycle of materials, in particular, must be analyzed also considering the role that different actors play in it; not only the technical characteristics of the materials have to be considered, but also the social context of development and application of materials. Such assumptions can be used also for interpreting the role of the actors in the challenges that contemporary societies are facing, particularly the promotion of energy saving and of the circular economy and more generally the transition towards decarbonization and dematerialization. In this paper, the focus is on a particular type of actors, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). They constitute a plethora of economic actors operating in numerous production sectors and at different levels of the value chains. SMEs orientations are important for achieving a better knowledge of the cycle of materials, especially in relation to the possibility of directing it towards the pursuit of environmental objectives such as energy saving and the circular economy. The paper stresses that considering the role of SMEs in such wide social and economic innovation process should illustrate peculiar aspects of the "internal"life of SMEs (culture, organizational skills, etc.) as well as the interaction with other actors within the context of operation of SMEs.  © SCF, 2021.},

Arising from the framework of the INTRIDE European project, this article has been structured starting from an introductory analysis of the demanded skills of designers and the needs of European Union (EU) companies in the current contem-porary scenario. As such, the reflection extends to the research methodology established for the development of a state of the art on soft, digital, and green skills as a scientific basis for the definition of a cross and interdisciplinary training course entitled Strategic design for innovation in the manufacturing sector. Thus, focusing on the Bologna Declaration (June 19, 1999) in which the need to build a "Euro-pean Higher Education Area" has been declared. Based on the achieved research results, the authors propose the INTRIDE Joint Master’s Degree Program (JMDP) as a cross and interdisciplinary training course for smart designers that will become the future innovation triggers for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU manufacturing sector. This, together with added competencies related to soft, digital, and green skills – as general ones – and design and technological – as specific ones. At the end of this scientific contribution, a discussion has been reported regarding a general reflection on the developed design process and the lessons learned in the application of the design methodology, com-bined with the suggestions for a sustainable use and implementation of the proposed training program. © 2022, Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH.

To investigate this question this paper uses a standard Input-Output modeling framework and data from 141 countries and regions to construct a new global dataset of employment, value-added, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (disaggregated into CO2 and Non-CO2 elements), and air pollution (including nine categories of air pollutants such as PM2.5) multipliers from supply side investments. We find that many of the traditional sectors in agriculture and industry have large employment multipliers, but also generate male dominant, lower skill employment, and tend to have higher emission multipliers. It is in economies dominated by these sectors that trade-offs to a 'greener' transition will emerge most sharply. However, we find a substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, so even in these economies, there exist other sectors with high employment multipliers and low emissions, including sectors that are more conducive to female employment. In addition, we find a high correlation between industries that generate GHG emissions, which cause long term climate impacts, and those that generate air pollution, which have immediate harmful impacts on human health, suggesting that policies could be designed to simultaneously confer longer climate benefits with immediate health improvements. Our results confirm some of the findings from recent research and shed new light on opportunities for greening economies.  © 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Lastly, we test for differential effects of GPP on different classes of green technologies (GTs). The main finding is that GPP is an important driver for the local generation of GTs. High availability of abstract skills in the local workforce also drives the generation of GTs and magnifies the positive effect of GPP.

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of buildings is a crucial milestone if European cities mean to reach their mitigation targets. The construction sector was responsible for 38% of the GHG emissions in 2020. From these emissions, 11% is calculated to be currently embodied in building materials. In this context, an evaluation from a life cycle perspective is becoming increasingly necessary to achieve the objectives set. Currently, there are different building rating systems (BRS) at European level that allow the evaluation of the degree of sustainability of buildings. During this study, the authors have evaluated to what extent and how the most extended five BRS (NF Habitat HQE, VERDE, DGNB, BREEAM, and HPI systems) in the European framework have integrated the life cycle methodology during their evaluation process. Four methodologies have been used in the research in order to analyse these five systems: quantitative assessment, multi-level perspective, mapping–gap analysis, and expert interviews. Although each methodology has produced different results, the need to harmonise the evaluation criteria at the European level, the insufficient consistency of data software, and the availability of skilled LCA professionals for wider LCA market penetration, among others, should be highlighted. The quality and harmonised data of construction products is required for LCA to give aggregated and transformative results. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, the effects of environmental training on the performance of organisations in the hospitality industry have so far been under-studied. At the same time, hospitality industry in India has attracted significant attention, and therefore deserves to be studied further. This study explores the mediating effects of green competencies and proactive environmental management maturity as well as the moderating effect of environmental commitment. In order to conduct empirical analysis, a survey instrument is developed for data collection. The results indicate the following relationships: (a) a positive and significant relationship between green training and environmental performance; (b) a mediating effect of green competencies; (c) a mediating effect of proactive environmental management maturity; and (d) a moderating effect of environmental commitment.

The present study identifies and explores the green competencies required at the workplace to perform ecological behaviour. No prior study has explored the required green competencies from employees at the workplace in higher education institutions to the researchers' knowledge. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research utilises the data generated from eighteen comprehensive interviews with the top five Malaysian green universities' employees. The study adopted the content analysis approach to explore contextually relevant competencies required for EEB in the workplace. Results: Six main green competencies, namely environmental awareness, environmental attitude, environmental knowledge, environmental consciousness, green mindfulness, and green ability, were generated from the analysis supporting ecological behaviour at the workplace. Conclusion: This research explored the required green competencies of employees to be environmental-friendly in the workplace by investigating the previously neglected domain required in the workplace. The research offers practical implications to universities and human resources (HR) to adopt accountabilities for an organisation to be environmentally sustainable. The recruitment committee and top management of higher education institutions should accentuate an environmental stance and green competencies in job descriptions to entice applicants with an environment-friendly mentality.  © 2022 Khalid Farooq et al., published by Sciendo.},

Countries voluntarily indicate what actions will be taken to achieve the declared goals. The construction sector is an industry that is under scrutiny due to its negative impact on the environment, but it also has the potential to reduce it. Activities that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions can be carried out at various levels in the construction industry. One of them is the appropriate preparation of the staff, including equipping them with the so-called green skills. This research aimed to determine the competency gaps of people employed in the construction industry, including competencies in the field of low-emission economy. For the purposes of the study, a questionnaire survey was carried out in Poland and the Czech Republic and based on the results obtained the appropriate competencies were determined that should be possessed by people employed in the construction sector, including competencies related to a low-emission economy. Competency profiles for people employed in the construction sector were built and competency gaps of these people were determined. In both countries, no competencies have been identified in any of checked areas that meet or exceed the requirements of managers according to specific competency profiles. © 2021 by the authors.

Many of these advances will also be broadly applicable to other areas of neurosurgery. We have grounded our predictions for future developments in an exploration of what patients and surgeons most desire as outcomes for care. We next examined the recent developments in the field and outlined several promising areas of future improvement in skull base surgery, per se, as well as identifying the new hospital support systems needed to accommodate these changes. These include, but are not limited to, advances in imaging, Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, 3-dimensional printing and rapid prototyping, master–slave and semiautonomous robots, artificial intelligence applications in all areas of medicine, telemedicine, and green technologies in hospitals. In addition, we have reviewed the therapeutic approaches using nanotechnology, genetic engineering, antitumor antibodies, and stem cell technologies to repair damage caused by traumatic injuries, tumors, and iatrogenic injuries to the brain and cranial nerves. Additionally, we have discussed the training requirements for future skull base surgeons and stressed the need for adaptability and change. However, the essential requirements for skull base surgeons will remain unchanged, including knowledge, attention to detail, technical skill, innovation, judgment, and compassion. We believe that active involvement in these rapidly evolving technologies will enable us to shape some of the future of our discipline to address the needs of both patients and our profession. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

One substantial aspect of this emerging sector is the shift of the automotive industry towards the production of electric vehicles (EVs). The automotive sector is a major employer in Europe, directly employing over 2.8 million people. However, little is known about the effects this structural transformation of the automotive industry will have on labor markets, in particular in the area of information and communications technology (ICT). This prevents effective planning by educational institutions, who seek to prepare their students for future labor markets, and industry stakeholders aiming to assemble effective teams. In this paper, we develop a framework to analyze labor market trends using digital trace data, and apply it to the case of the EV industry. We track demand-side trends in the labor market using job advertisements from LinkedIn and supply-side trends using data from StackExchange and GitHub. Using natural language processing methods, we categorize the skills sought by EV industry employers on the demand side and topics of interest to individuals on the supply side. We also highlight those programming languages and frameworks most salient in the EV industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The research used the quantitative (mathematical regression function, correlation matrix, and R-squared) and qualitative (the SWOT matrix of the agriculture sector in Romania) methods. The data on Romanian agriculture were gathered from Eurostat for the period of 2006–2019. The results showed that there is a direct and positive relationship between the OA and its influencing factors. Moreover, it revealed the negative relationships between the employees in agriculture (−0.58), air pollutants (−0.49), agriculture land (−0.42), irrigation norm (−0.39), agriculture training (−0.33) and the OA, and positive relationships between the area under organic farming (0.56), the average area per holding (0.56), the number of tractors (0.53) and the OA. Romania is a country where employment and agriculture areas are greater than in other EU countries; however, the results of our research highlight the significance of a careful analysis of the influencing factors, of making the difference between the thin line of sustainable performance, of developing new measures, of reducing risks, and of gaining new knowledge and agricultural skills, as an important activity, especially for Romania. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between green human resource management bundle practices and green innovation and their impact on sustainability performance as measured by the Triple Bottom Lines (i.e., environmental, social, and economic performance). It is decided to use a quantitative approach in order to collect data from 335 small- and medium-sized (SMEs) businesses operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through a customized survey. Structure equation modeling was applied through smart PLS to analyze the collected data. Results show that green human resource management bundle practices have a positive and significant impact on the sustainable performance of SMEs. Furthermore, results indicate that green innovation has a significant impact on sustainable performance and green innovation partially mediates the relationship between green human resource practices and sustainable performance of SMEs. This study demonstrates that the implementation of GI by firms can be enhanced through the use of GHRM, which, in turn, would enhance the firms’ sustainability.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to perform a psychometric evaluation of the internal green marketing (IGM) scale in the context of consumer, industrial and service industry from a developing economy. Drawing on IGM theory, this study validates the measurement scales to operationalize IGM as green internal communication (GIC), green skill development (GSD) and green rewards (GRs). Design/methodology/approach: The sample was drawn from the consumer, industrial and service industries in Jammu and Kashmir, India, using a random sampling method. Data were collected from consumer, industrial and service industries in two phases through a self-administrated questionnaire-based survey. In total, 137 managers responded during the first phase, and 368 managers responded during the second phase. During the first phase, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to uncover the underlying dimensions of IGM, and during the second phase, data were analyzed to test the validity of the IGM scale through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings: EFA suggested a three-dimension scale (green internal communication (GIC), green skill development (GSD), and green rewards (GR)) which was confirmed by CFA. The findings of the study demonstrate that IGM is a valid and reliable scale to capture the individual-level perception of the employees with respect to the green internal marketing of an organization. Practical implications: This paper is expected to provide valuable insights into the area of internal green marketing (IGM) about an industry that can be of immense help to domestic and international marketers in formulating human resource (HR)/marketing strategies. Further, it provides a wide-ranging scale that can act as a base for future research studies that aim to explore internal green marketing (IGM) in different organizational settings. Originality/value: IGM is embedded in three underlying elements as GIC, GSD and GRs. It is suitable to the practitioner and researchers to operationalize IGM as a second-order construct in future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Radical technological advancements and the relentless progression of climate change compel organisations to ensure their workforce consistently exercise their creativity toward innovative green initiatives. These endeavours are essential to achieve the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). To do so, organisations require competencies fundamental to smart technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA). STARA competencies are relevant for leaders to bolster green organisational innovative evidence (GOIE). GOIE can help to attract potential investors keen on advancing the UN's SDG agenda on environmental sustainability. However, eclipsed by a volatile environment, and despite the green innovation potential of several manufacturing organisations, investors are reluctant to invest and commit funds without evidence of green innovation. We therefore, investigate how leader STARA competence (LSC), green creativity components (task motivation, creativity skills and expertise) and environmental dynamism can aid organisations to boost their GOIE. Our key findings are as follows: (a) though green task motivation shows a stronger association with green creativity skills, LSC has a large influence on green creativity skills; (b) green creativity skills exert a strong influence on GOIE while also playing a competitive and complimentary mediating role in our model and (c) environmental dynamism is negatively associated with green creativity skills and GOIE. Furthermore, to validate indirect (v) effects size in mediation analysis, we propose a new and more approachable benchmark for v effect size estimations. Organisational and environmental policy implications are discussed. © 2021 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {We document the perceptions, practices and policy options in managing lowland bamboo [Oxytenanthera abyssinica] in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State (BGRS) in Ethiopia, particularly to enable small-scale enterprises (SSE) to become more active in this field. This region hosts the largest extent of natural bamboo forests in Ethiopia. There is a recent push to realize bamboo's economic and environmental potential in Ethiopia, which puts SSEs as crucial actors. There is little or scattered published information on local perceptions and practices surrounding natural bamboo forest management and options for realizing bamboo's potential from a subnational/local perspective in Africa, including in Ethiopia. In 2018, we conducted a literature review, spatial analysis, participatory mapping, and interviewed experts working in governmental and non-governmental organizations and local stakeholders in BGRS. We find some consensus of the environmental importance of bamboo. In contrast, there is some debate at the subnational level about the economic importance of bamboo, leading to decisions favouring other land uses. Bamboo forests in this region suffer neglect, as they are perceived to be 'owned by no one and used by everyone' and will continue to be there without management. Lack of market-driven opportunities, bamboo-specific training among foresters, data on economic contributions of bamboo, and regulations or guidelines to support existing laws have prevented effective management of the bamboo resource. There are multiple bamboo management approaches that open economic opportunities for SSEs in the region. There needs to be more clarity on how to secure land use rights over bamboo forests, accessible financing, market linkages, business training, and low-tech/low-cost technologies to encourage the development of bamboo SSEs. HIGHLIGHTS Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State (BGRS) has the highest proportion and area of natural bamboo forests in Ethiopia, mostly lowland bamboo (Oxytenanthera abyssinica). In BGRS, bamboo resources were poorly managed and wasting away. There is a lack of bamboo-focused training among foresters, and local bamboo value chains are under-developed. We characterize the existing bamboo business models, and the state and non-state actors influencing the sustainable management of bamboo resources and bamboo value chains. We identify the support needed by small-scale enterprises, including training in business and bamboo-specific technical skills, access to financing adapted to their capacity and needs, improved infrastructure and market linkages, and land use planning that accounts for the economic and environmental values of bamboo resources. © 2020 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

	abstract = {The key aim of a transition to a Green Economy is to enable economic growth and investment while increasing environmental quality and social inclusiveness. In this context, eco-entrepreneurship plays an important role. This paper focuses on three waste-based eco-enterprises in Sri Lanka, namely; Katana Upcycles, Paalam Products and Yaal fibre. All three eco-enterprises upcycle plastic waste. SWOT analysis and a Triple bottom line (TBL) Impact assessment were used to develop an integrated framework to understand the enablers, barriers and the impact they create. The study suggests that eco-enterprises achieve a mix of social, economic and environmental impacts through their businesses, including waste reduction, creating job opportunities and introducing eco-friendly alternatives to the market. These eco-enterprises face numerous challenges in sustaining their growth and scale-up.

	abstract = {The recently proposed Green Deals and ‘building back better’ plans have affirmed the importance to make green transitions inclusive. This is particularly related to the labour market, which may witness significant changes. Empirically, this issue has until now received limited attention. The links between poverty and climate change are explored mainly through the lenses of climate change adaptation, or via the effects of rising energy prices on the purchasing power of poor households. We aim to address this gap by using results from a simulation of the global energy transition required to meet the 2-degree target, and compare this to a 6-degree baseline scenario. The simulation with a multi-regional input–output model finds that, overall, this transition results in a small net job increase of 0.3% globally, with cross-country heterogeneity. We complement this macro-level analysis with cross-country household data to draw implications of the effects on poverty through labour market outcomes. The few job losses will be concentrated in specific industries, while new jobs will be created in industries that currently witness relatively high in-work poverty rates, such as construction. We show that high in-work poverty in the industries of interest, and especially in middle-income countries, is often associated with low skills and an insufficient reach of social protection mechanisms. We conclude that green transitions must ensure that the jobs created are indeed decent including fair wages, adequate working conditions, sufficient social protection measures, and accessible to the vulnerable and poorest households. © 2021 The Author(s).

Geographic and spatially sensitive concepts and approaches to sustainability and greening are particularly relevant as best practices and success models are not easily transferable across different contexts. But how can students learn the necessary skills to connect theory with practice? Based on a third-year geography module at a British university that teaches green economy concepts, this paper presents insights from a problem- and project-based group learning exercise designed to help students translate conceptual approaches into practice highlighting the strength of geographic thinking. As part of the exercise, students work in groups to develop a green project that they present in a green dragons’ den-style ideas pitch to an expert panel for evaluation. Students are tasked to develop innovative, feasible and applicable proposals that address specific sustainability challenges. Findings from five consecutive years of teaching illustrate the value of project- and problem-based learning to students through the diversity of practical applications, the need for critical thinking and context-dependent assessments and enhanced transferable skills. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Green skills need to be developed in vocational education for sustainable future. However, the vocational high school curriculum of agricultural food processing technology in Indonesia does not explicitly state the development of green skills. Teaching materials, such as module are needed to develop vocational students’ green skills. This study aimed to develop green skills module for meat processing technology at vocational high schools. Development of this module used the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model. The contents for a green skills module were developed based on a need analysis for the elements of green skills that must be developed in vocational high schools, curriculum and a literature review analysis related to sustainability in meat processing technology. The module was designed using a scientific approach to strengthen active student learning as per the 2013 curriculum policy for vocational high schools in Indonesia. The developed module was sent to the four selected experts for validating. It gained score of 88.56% in material aspect about meat processing technology by the material experts and 89.18% in media aspects by the media experts. These scores mean that the module was categorized as very feasible. Based on the pre-test and post-test of students’ green skills with this module, the calculation of n-gain test was 0.4 which means moderate category. The findings of this study imply that the module can be used in learning to improve student's green skills.

This study explored the skills that the informal manufacturers used to navigate the uncertain business environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 27 telephone interviews were conducted with informal entrepreneurs who were manufacturers of agricultural machinery at Mbare Magaba and Gaza home industry in Harare, Zimbabwe. Purposive and snow ball sampling were used to identify information rich sources. The authors used thematic analysis in identifying recurrent themes from this study. Findings: The study results show that business agility motivated most informal manufacturers to restructure their business to sustain their operations. With the closure of formal companies, the informal manufacturers adopted slowing and narrowing loops through purchasing broken down agricultural machines for repairs or remanufacturing of durable machines for their low-income customer base. Most young and formally trained manufacturers adopted a prospector strategic behaviour as they used digital platforms to network with business associates for supplies, gathering market intelligence, making and receiving electronic payments and establishing virtual distant markets whilst the older manufacturers resorted mostly to a defender strategic behaviour of engaging their usual customers for repair jobs and a few referrals. Originality/value: This study offers unique insights with respect to skills required for the sustainable and strategic management of small and medium enterprises during times of crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Green human resource management (GHRM) and sustainable green logistics (SGLOG) are some of the mechanisms by which sustainable corporate environmental management could be consummated. However, prior studies linking GHRM and green logistics are lacking in the literature. This paper extends prior efforts by developing a model linking GHRM and SGLOG. Design/methodology/approach: An integrative review of extant literature on green human resource management and sustainable green logistics was conducted, and an integrative model developed. Findings: Improving environmental performance is a key way that businesses can improve their corporate social responsibility and brand image. The resulting model includes expanded components of GHRM (training, development, compensation, awards and recognition, recruitment, and performance management) and of SGLOG (transportation and shipping, warehousing, packaging, and reverse logistics). Categories of shipping and transportation include the following facets: transportation intensity, modal split, emissions intensity, energy efficiency, and vehicle utilization efficiency. The model also highlights the mediating role of management and employee attitudes, knowledge, and skills in the GHRM-SGLOG link, as well as their interaction. Research limitations/implications: Green human resource management is associated with sustainable green logistics. This association is theoretically mediated by management and employee attitudes, knowledge, and skills. Top management support and influence of other stakeholders are key facilitators. Practical implications: The paper suggests potential barriers to GHRM and SGLOG adoption/diffusion and panaceas. It also proposes some key drivers of sustainable green logistics and corporate environmental management. Firms must carry out their operations in ways that do not compromise societal and environmental well-being. High economic performance alone no longer suffice. A balanced performance that also emphasizes social and environmental well-being (the triple bottom line, 3BL) can be achieve through the implementation of the proposed model. Originality/value: The integrative model presented in the paper advances the current understanding of the link between GHRM and SGLOG. The paper adds additional value by unveiling some key future research directions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Many stakeholders plan and implement a daycare work program, including patients, caregivers, trainers, staff members, and professionals. The literature on daycare work programs is limited. The present study aimed to understand the impact and facilitators of a selected daycare work program (Green Skills Program [GSP]) from the lens of stakeholders. Methods: Criterion sampling was used to recruit the stakeholders who have been part of GSP. Twenty-seven stakeholders were interviewed using a researcher-prepared semi-structured interview schedule. Atlas. ti version 9 was used for coding. Thematic analysis was done to identify themes. Results: Stakeholders considered GSP easy, enjoyable, and accommodative to patients with different functioning levels. GSP participation was deemed as gainful engagement and vital to day-structuring. The patients worked in groups, which promoted peer learning and teamwork. Various behavioral, social, and work-related improvements were noted among the patients by the stakeholders. Incentives and social reinforcements were significant motivators. Stakeholders were content with the trainer's way of teaching the patients and felt that she possessed many essential attributes that motivated them and improved their work outcomes. Conclusions: While conceiving daycare work programs, ease of doing activities, accommodation of patients with varying levels of functionality, trainer's aptitude, and use of reinforcements should be considered. © 2022 Medknow.

	abstract = {The slow and inefficient environmental performance of universities is drawing the attention of scholars towards behavioural change in employees rather than just relying on technological upgrades. Drawing upon the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) theory, the purpose of this study is first to examine the influence of Green Human Resource Management (HRM) practices (green competence building practices, green motivation enhancing practices, and green employee involvement practices) on the organisational citizenship behaviour towards the environment (OCBE) of academic staff and, in turn, its impact on the environmental performance. Second, the mediating impact of OCBE between each of Green HRM practices and environmental performance is assessed. The data were collected from September until November 2017 on two campuses of a renowned public research university in Malaysia. Using quantitative research design, a structured questionnaire was used among the academic staff of the university. Convenience sampling was used to select the respondents from both campuses, and the Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling technique was used to analyse the data, which comprised 122 respondents. Overall findings showed that three sets of Green HRM practices based on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity framework had a significant impact on OCBE. Furthermore, OCBE had a significant relationship with environmental performance. For the mediation analysis, the results showed that OCBE exhibited by academic staff acted as a means through which the Green HRM practices of a university can positively influence the environmental performance of a university campus. The originality of this study rests in shedding light on Green HRM practices in the higher education sector and highlighting the critical role of academic staff's environmentally friendly behaviour for improving the environmental performance of a university. © 2020},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to highlight the importance of implementing green training as a part of green management practices in organizational operations by building the arguments through the lens of Ability–Motivation–Opportunity (AMO) theory. In this regard, the mediating impact of green competencies on the association between green training and organizational efficiency is determined. Design/methodology/approach: The research followed a quantitative and cross-sectional approach. The study involved ISO-14001 certified textile manufacturing organizations to better serve the research purpose. The responses were collected from 235 managerial-level employees through purposive sampling. The data analysis was performed by using structural equation modelling to examine the interrelated dependence of the variables. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that green training is essential for environmentally responsible organizations to attain their goals of efficient resource consumption in addition to serving the greater cause of environmental protection. There is a dire need to impart environmental-friendly competencies to the employees who resultantly become able to adopt eco-efficient ways of doing business. Research limitations/implications: This study also has limitations regarding the generalizability of its results. It is primarily because of the limited sample size and restricted geographical domain. Additionally, AMO theory has not been empirically tested in this study. Practical implications: Progressive textile manufacturers need to incorporate a consistent policy for green management practices to meet the expectation of their international clients and to remain competitive in international markets. It is equally important for the governmental authorities to design such environmental policies which necessitate the need of incorporating pro-environment business practices and measuring their outcomes. Originality/value: This study will contribute to enrich the literature by offering an empirical analysis of green training for achieving the organizational efficiency in textile manufacturing sector. It will be a novel context to contribute to the literature of green management practices and its related fields. Moreover, the study is one of its kind that uses the AMO theory to identify the mediating role of green competencies for understanding the association between green training and organizational efficiency. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, the social context has been characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and inequalities, with significant impacts on people, groups, and communities. Covid-19 Pandemic has accentuated social discriminations, as inequalities affecting women (World Health Organization, 2018), with repercussions on general income, health, education (Office for National Statistics, 2021) that have been exhausting people, the economic system, and the welfare state (Antonicelli et al., 2020). To cope with these difficulties, on april 10, 2020 the Italian Prime Minister appointed a Task Force of 17 experts with scientific and applicative skills in social and economic fields. Within a short time, the Task Force aimed at identifying practical solutions priming the relaunch of the country. Given the women’s central role in the country’s social and economic development, in the final version of the Task Force plan, Gender Equality was indicated as the third—strategic and innovative—axis, together with Digitization and Green Economy. Its rationale was to promote gender equality in every action, with an allocation of dedicated economic resources. Specifically, the Task Force’s Working Group named “Individuals, Families, and Society” proposed specific initiatives aimed at recognizing and bridging the gender gaps in the various areas, and measures to support vulnerable people. This contribution will focus on the central role that the Task Force has played in encouraging systematic attention to women, considering their needs and the social-economic impacts on their choices and well-being. It will illustrate the Task Force’s internal dynamics (there were four women out of 17 people, then increased), the process of inclusion of different perspectives, both gender and multidisciplinary, and the practices suggested for the post-pandemic rebuilding. The final goal will be to show the inability to promote innovation, resilience and sustainability, without working with and for the community. As shown by the Italian Task Force, an innovative change must consider a multiplicity of perspectives that reflects the complexity of reality, even in the political and decision-making debate. Therefore, it’s central to build multidisciplinary teams that include various professionals from the social sectors, as Social Psychology, Sociology, Pedagogy, Political Philosophy, Demography, and Social Statistics, both women and men.

	abstract = {Investments in the green economy are used for both environmental goals and fiscal stimulus. The success of these investments depends, at least in part, on whether they create new jobs and whether such jobs are available to workers hurt by a green transition. We evaluate the employment effect of green investments from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Most job creation from green ARRA investments is permanent and emerged in the post-ARRA period, but the plausible range of estimates is extremely wide (zero to twenty-five jobs per $1 million). Such large uncertainty on aggregate effects masks substantial heterogeneity across communities. The green stimulus mostly benefited areas with a greater prevalence of preexisting green skills that created 40 percent additional jobs than average communities. New jobs are primarily manual labor and in occupations performing green tasks, especially in renewable energy. However, manual labor wages do not increase. Descriptive evidence suggests that the skill gap between green energy and fossil fuel workers is modest, but green jobs require significantly more training. Because the spatial distribution of skills and jobs matters, using green stimuli can help reshape the economy in the long run but may also exacerbate regional inequities associated with the green energy transition. © 2021, Brookings Institution Press.

	abstract = {Infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth, which should be resurrected through green competency to rethink the infrastructure strategy and economic prosperity in dealing with local and global issues. There are several linkages such as energy efficiency between Green Infrastructure (GI) and Green Economy (GE) which have absolutely delivered remarkable rewards and influences in environmental, social, economic pillar of sustainable development (SD). However, these influences have not been cleared and unknown in priors’ literature. This study proposes a methodological approach to deliberate: the Analytical Network Process (ANP) to prioritise GI criteria with considering their mutual influences, which would be primed to the enactment of GE in the context of SD; and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to implement GE in SD context. The ANP results as inputs info for ANFIS method indicated that the majority of effectiveness belonged to four primary GI criteria (approximately more than 80%), namely, Affordability, Resource Efficiency, Energy Efficiency, and Air Quality. The ANFIS results for achieving each GE indicators showed that the most effective combination of upward interaction among GI criteria are belonged to: Affordability with Resource Efficiency (Eco-Environment indicator), Energy Efficiency with Resource Efficiency (Socio-Environment indicator), and Affordability with Energy Efficiency (Socio-Economic indicator). In conclusion, the best interaction for GE implementation belonged to Socio-Environment and Eco-Environment indicators through the greatest interface among Affordability, Energy Efficiency, and Resource Efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The overall willingness of smallholder farmers to adopt new green technologies remains low, in spite of the great progress made in understanding the factors that affect their decision. The present study introduces an interdisciplinary approach combining positive psychology and sustainable development studies to show that two personal resources – self-control (a learned repertoire of goal-directed skills that enable people to act upon their aims) and cognitive goal-oriented hope (the ability to follow different routes to pursue one's goal), prompt the adoption of technologies by smallholder farmers. Both personal resources facilitate achieving future goals and changing existing circumstances. A theoretical moderation model on the adoption of agricultural technologies aimed to protect soil degradation in Nepal is proposed and empirically tested. Data were collected from 268 households in the Jhapa district by a face-to-face questionnaire. A multiple regression analysis tested and confirmed the hypothesized moderation model. Following the discovery of a significant interaction, the nature of the interaction was farther explored by calculating simple slopes. Analysis results show a significant positive connection between self-control (p-value = 0.002), hope (p-value = 0.005), information (p-value < 0.001), and technology adoption. Self-control was also found to have a significant moderating effect in enhancing a positive association between receiving information and technology adoption (p-value = 0.017). In addition to its theoretical innovation and empirical contribution, the importance of this study lies in its practical implications, given that policy, education, and communication may influence hope and self-control levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

It further explores these hypothesized relationships across brands of physical products and services. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using an online survey from 826 Chinese consumers. Structural equation modeling is used to test the proposed conceptual model. Findings: Our results demonstrate that green transparency and green competence enhancement positively affect consumer green brand attachment (i.e. self–green brand connection and green brand prominence) which subsequently influence consumers’ loyalty toward green brands and their resistance to negative information. Finally, the development of green brand attachment across brands of products and services is found to be different. Research limitations/implications: Extending the conceptual model to other cultural contexts is suggested. Using the experimental design to examine other boundary conditions is recommended. Practical implications: This study provides recommendations for marketers, especially brand managers, to facilitate green brand communications to strengthen consumer–brand relationships. Originality/value: This study extends past research by examining two types of green brand attachment via a cognitive schema lens. Also, it shows the internal cognitive process by which green brand communications potentially promote consumer behavioral outcomes through green brand attachment. Lastly, it highlights differences in the development of green brand loyalty and consumer resistance to negative information across brands of products and services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The environmental issue was a debating topic over the past decades, but the knowledge, skill, and attitude among the people are still never changed. Several studies found that a huge contributor to waste is the industrial sector. Due to that, the green industry policies were created for environmental justice in order to minimise the greenhouse gases, and the creation of the green industries was started. The green industries were opening jobs opportunity for green jobs, and fulfilling the jobs that required someone competent with green skills. To be competent, they needed in mastering the three dimensions of green skills: knowledge, skill, and attitude. However, the skill shortage among the workers arose. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore green skills elements from the industrial perspective in skill dimension. In this study a Delphi technique were applied which started with interview session among experts. The semi-structured interview was conducted, and the protocol interview was validated through peer review and member checking. Six experts were selected from the green industries and the selection according to the characteristics such as the background qualification, job position, working experience, and knowledge in the green industry. The data was transcribed by using paper and pen, and the thematic analysis was used. From the interview session, a total of eight elements has been identified in green skills namely; waste skills, design skills, planning, procurement, and material skills, energy and water skills, communication skills, management skills, leadership and teamwork skills, problem-solving and critical thinking skills. This exploration was useful in order to conduct the next round of Delphi technique in terms of checklist items among the experts. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

This paper uses detailed industry-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Green Goods and Services survey to examine how the provision of so-called green goods and services has affected various aspects of the US economy. Our descriptive results reveal that those states and industries that were relatively green in 2010 became even greener in 2011. To investigate further we include green goods and services in a production function. The results show that between 2010 and 2011 industries that have increased their share of green employment have reduced their productivity although this negative correlation was only for the manufacture of green goods and not for the supply of green services. In further analysis we investigate skill-technology complementarities in the production of green goods and services and show that industries that increased their provision of green goods and services grew more slowly, reduced their expenditure on technology inputs and increased their demand for medium educated workers, whilst simultaneously reducing their demand for lower skilled workers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The drivers of eco-innovation (EI) have been the focus of much research in the past. Some of these drivers have been external to the firm, such as regulation, whereas others have been internal, including its resources and capabilities and its environmental strategy. However, the analysis of the impact of those drivers on EI has too often been carried out as if they were separated from each other. In reality, the EI drivers are likely to interact. This paper tries to cover this gap in the literature using a holistic and integrated approach. Survey data from 97 chemical firms were analyzed using partial least squares to determine the critical drivers of EI and their interconnections. Our results indicate that, in fact, the impact of some drivers might not be direct but is mediated by their influence on other drivers. This is the case with environmental collaboration, environmental knowledge, green skills, consumer pressure, and export behavior, which have an indirect effect on EI through their impact on environmental strategies. Therefore, our results suggest that environmental strategy is a central mediator and a powerful driver for the entire model. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

To tackle this challenge, Thailand has produced policies designed to enhance environmental conservation. However, without the development of its labour force with suitable and up to date job skills this challenge becomes difficult to achieve. This paper presents a rationale for the emergence of green occupations as a means of transitioning Thailand’s tourism sector into a low carbon economy. A mechanism for achieving this goal is by training and retraining the workforce with a set of well-defined green knowledge and skill sets. These can be developed through the development and implementation of ‘green competencies’.

Precisely, the study modelled the effects of monetary green tax incentives and green building skills on supply factors affecting green commercial property investment. The study was based on a survey of 350 real estate developers, and investors in Malaysia and the model was validated for reliability and validity. The structural equation modelling indicated that monetary green tax incentives and green skills have significant causal effects on supply. Among these factors, life cost saving motivations, government policies, green certification, developers’ expected rate of return motivations, and market strategy benefit motivations were significant. Monetary green tax incentives were, however, found to have the most significant effect on green commercial property supply and investment. © 2018},

Quantitative and qualitative data through pretest/post-test, questionnaires, and semistructured interviews were collected with a focus on green building–based English (GBbE) reading and listening skills. Results proved the effectiveness of the GBELA for both high-achievement (HA) and low-achievement (LA) groups. Furthermore, correlations were found between the HA group and ease of use of the GBELA. The correlations among learner perceptions and self-efficacy showed that a well-designed context-aware learning system can help learners enhance self-efficacy in CAULL mode.

At the same time, however, various barriers pose challenges to small businesses in their transition to a circular economy, namely a lack of financial resources and lack of technical skills. The aim of this paper is to increase knowledge and understanding about the barriers and enablers experienced by SMEs when implementing circular economy business models. Looking first at the barriers that prevent SMEs from realising the benefits of the circular economy, an investigation is carried out in the form of a literature review and an analysis of a sample of SME case studies that are featured on the GreenEcoNet EU-funded web platform. Several enabling factors that help SMEs adopt circular economy practices are then identified. The paper concludes that although various policy instruments are available to help SMEs incorporate circular economy principles into their business models, several barriers remain. The authors recommend that European and national policies strengthen their focus on greening consumer preferences, market value chains and company cultures, and support the recognition of SMEs' green business models. This can be achieved through the creation of dedicated marketplaces and communities of practice, for example.. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {While green innovation has a positive impact on firms’ performance, some established firms that initiate green innovation activities (referring to diversifying green entrants) could suffer from insufficient new green knowledge and skills. Since adopting a sustainability orientation helps firms commit to the creation of superior sustainable practices, and efficiently invest resources necessary to develop appropriate new green products, leading to superior green innovation performance, sustainability orientation offers an alternative approach for diversifying green entrants to achieve green innovation success. Building on resource-based, knowledge-based, and capabilities theories, this study aims to identify key factors that enable sustainability orientation of diversifying green entrants and enhance its effect on green innovation performance. As sustainability issues frequently occur upstream at the supplier level, and since supplier involvement effectively determines new product success, this study theorizes that diversifying green entrants that adopt sustainability orientation require two types of green supplier involvement (as a knowledge source and a co-creator) to enhance the effect of sustainability orientation on green innovation performance. Green knowledge-processing capability and green R&D capability complement green supplier involvement as a knowledge source and green supplier involvement as a co-creator, respectively, to further enhance the amount of green innovation performance. Based on a longitudinal dataset of 336 diversifying green entrants, the results support all our hypotheses. Interestingly, an additional analysis suggests that when diversifying green entrants implement green supplier involvement as a co-creator, they achieve greater green innovation performance than those who implement green supplier involvement as a knowledge source. These findings provide important theoretical implications and practical guidance for established firms to pursue green innovation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

Human resources equipped with specific generic green skills will become a catalyst to penetrate the green job market. On the principle that skills can be shaped through education and training, a qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews with senior academics from the School of Education, of a local university in southern Peninsular Malaysia. The interview data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo. The findings showed that generic green skills are additional skills which complement existing generic skills and focus on conserving and maintaining the quality of the environment. Pertaining to that, embedding generic green skills in teaching and learning activities can be carried out through the ingenuous use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) which involves digital skill, internet technology and electricity saving consumption. Furthermore, additional studies of generic green skills are required to contribute to sustainable development. Copyright©2019 by authors, all rights reserved.},

It reviews the current situation of the extractive model, which has limited development of the legal and philosophical apparatus of human rights, towards a model based on the understanding of the human rights paradigm, helping to build more egalitarian relationships, providing opportunities for the development of public policies that favor the diversification of the development model and the incorporation of low carbon projects, to support the sustainability of the Amazon and its people. The key legal and institutional issues affecting indigenous and rural populations are reviewed in order to strengthen the model of diverse development, relying on the development of the skills its population has. © Caderno CRH.

The purpose of this research is explore the elements of green innovative skills that are considered for integration in building construction courses at technical colleges for economic sustainability in Nigeria. In this study, Data was collected using quantitative approach using a sample of 308 respondents. The identified elements were analysed via descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and Exploratory Factor analysis (EFA) which will greatly contribute to the body of knowledge. For the EFA, the recommended assumption were duly met and was conducted to test the factorial validity (construct) and to eliminate poor variables if found (observed variables) with a view to increasing the probability of Goodness-of-Fit for the results. In this analysis “Principal component analysis (PCA)” was the extraction method, “Varimax” was selected for factor rotation.In testing the construct validity; correlation matrix (>.3 and <.9) was calculated to confirm the inter-item correlation; “Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin KMO of (>.5) and anti-image correlations AIs diagonals' value of (>.5) were computed to test the sampling adequacy. “Barltts';s test” (Significant at 0.000) was conducted to test whether the correlation between the variables are sufficiently large for factor analysis; and “communalities” were calculated to test the proportion of common variance within variables; and the percentage of the total variance explained (> 60%) were computed and shown. The findings for this study includeability to;plug into different networks across the globe and identify the nature of a problem your product or service will be solving. It is recommended that to achieve economic sustainability via the contribution of the building construction sector, there is need for proper utilization of these findings to enable BCT students acquire green innovation skills. © BEIESP.},

Service learning is a teaching pedagogy that combines meaningful community service with academic instruction. Service learning project enriches students’ experiences by involving them in community service activities and relating those experiences to their academic and personal development. Employing the theme Let’s Recycle—Green Technology Service Learning project in a decision making course, this article demonstrates that undergraduates can learn to apply decision making skills while being able to generate fresh ideas and create ‘new’ products from recycled materials. Eighty-five undergraduate students from various faculties participated in this project. Employing demonstration technique as their oral presentation, the students demonstrated how to make ‘new’ products from recycled materials in front of real jury and audience. Based from the analysis of qualitative data such as students’ oral presentations, students’ reflection papers, and personal interviews, students expressed their enthusiasm in doing this project. Killing two birds with one stone, the students acknowledged that through this service learning project, they have learned and undergone the actual process of decision making while at the same time, learn to appreciate recycling activities. But most of all, these service learning activities have enhanced the students’ confidence to talk passionately about their own recycling ideas. The project has also given the students that rare opportunities for them to be creative and for some, the venue to showcase their potential recyclable products. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.},

A myriad of studies have been conducted on generic skills, and in Malaysia’s ‘greening’ development process, generic green skills have begun to attract many academics and industry players. This paper reviews several articles on generic green skills associated with the green technology industry. Document analysis was conducted to scrutinise initial information extracted from electronic databases viz Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Science Direct, Academia and EBCOHost. The findings showed that endeavours to acquire sustainable development in Malaysia are flourishing and prolific. Government agencies were seen as playing a notable role in strengthening generic green skills among employees in the green technology industry alongside international organisations and regional partners to ensure that development is compatible with maintaining the quality of the environment. In the near future, generic green skills are expected to receive solemn attention from academics and researchers, as well as become key criteria by employers in hiring new employees. Hence, further studies are needed to refine the generic green skills in balancing the development process with environmental sustainability. © BEIESP.},

Meanwhile, the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is growing rapidly in the U.S. and generating many jobs that represent employment opportunities for laid off coal workers. In order to determine the viability of a smooth transition from coal to PV-related employment, this paper provides an analysis of the cost to retrain current coal workers for solar photovoltaic industry employment in the U.S. The current coal industry positions are determined, the skill sets are evaluated and the salaries are tabulated. For each type of coal position, the closest equivalent PV position is determined and then the re-training time and investment are quantified. These values are applied on a state-by-state basis for coal producing states employing the bulk of coal workers as a function of time using a reverse seniority retirement program for the current American fleet of coal-powered plants. The results show that a relatively minor investment in retraining would allow the vast majority of coal workers to switch to PV-related positions even in the event of the elimination of the coal industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Environmental performance of companies not only rely on design and manufacturing aspects but it is also affected by the partners' social as well as environmental performance. For companies, recycling and assets recovery process, as well as final disposal of waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), requires recycling partners to be equipped with green competencies (GC). With the scope of this paper, selection of most desirable recycling partner is an important task and complex decision for managers of electronic companies. This paper presents a three-phase novel hybrid methodology for partner selection by electronic companies. The first phase involves extensive literature for identification of green competencies (GC) criteria and then finalize seven main criteria and forty-eight sub-criteria with experts' opinion, the second phase involves fuzzy AHP method which is used to calculate relative weight and rank the selection criteria and third phase involves ranking of recycling partners’ alternative with respect to GC criteria weights using novel VIKOR. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to check the robustness and stability of the framework. The results indicate that resource and environmental management capabilities (REC), green core competencies (GCC), and regulatory obligation and risk compliance (RRC) are the key criteria for partner selection process. © 2019},

	abstract = {In 2012, Malaysia launched its bioeconomy program, with the palm oil sector as one of the main pillars. In focusing on the societal processes that accompany the Malaysian plans to establish a bioeconomy, it is of special interest to understand which occupation groups in the palm oil sector are included and which are excluded from the socio-economic targets of the program. Research on the bioeconomy, as well as a green economy more broadly, often neglect the possible effects of green economy models on labor markets. I argue that low-skilled migrant workers employed in the Malaysian palm oil sector are structurally excluded from the national goal of enhancing the living and working conditions of the population by transforming into a bioeconomy. This exclusion intersects with a specific precarity caused by the socio-economic status of low-skilled migrant workers. The article shows that Malaysia's bioeconomy program reinforces the precarity of this group of workers, expressed in the lack of perspectives for upward mobility, their discrimination on the labor market, and in social barriers preventing them from further training. The findings presented are based on expert interviews and semi-structured qualitative interviews with workers from Sabah. © 2019 SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies.},

Following negotiations, OECD members resolved to heighten and support innovation and technology investments in the public and private sectors aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This study conducted a system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) analysis to investigate how innovation and technology investments influence carbon emissions in selected OECD economies from 2000 to 2014. Using data from the OECD database and the World Development Indicators (World Bank database), it employed four proxies of innovation and technology investments, namely, renewable energy consumption, the number of researchers, spending on research and development and the number of triadic patent families. The results indicated that, after applying the dynamic model and controlling for endogeneity, renewable energy consumption and spending on research and development have a statistically significant negative relationship with carbon emissions. The number of triadic patent families illustrates a positive and significant relationship with carbon emissions, but in the case of the number of researchers, the relationship was positive but not significant. Overall, this suggests that innovation and technology investments in these countries affect emissions differently and still have the potential to reduce environmental quality. It is concluded that ensuring that patents include natural environmental standard specifications and that researchers are better equipped with green skills and knowledge would enhance the achievement of zero-emission targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {One of the strategies being advocated in response to climate change is the need to transition to a low carbon economy. Current projections show that within this transition, new jobs will be created, some eliminated and most others subjected to change. This article reports findings from interviews with a selection of twenty participants who are involved in the formation and/or deployment of green skills. The participants were asked about their perceptions of (1) how jobs are changing in the transition to a green economy (2) how are adult learners developing and using green skills, and (3) what are some of the main drivers and blockers to the development and use of green skills. The data are presented as vignettes from various positions of supply and demand within the emerging green economy. The findings of this study report that the organisations and the training providers are motivated to develop and/or deploy green jobs and green skills for a range of different reasons. These include the making of a favourable business case, environmental beliefs about conserving the finite resources of the planet and, for health and wellbeing reasons. Some blockers that have been identified are the initial capital outlay for any changes, and the need to address some inconsistencies that arise over time in the financial arrangements when trying to work out the business case. This has led the designers and contractors working in renewable energy to call for a level playing field with those who provide and utilise finite resources and non-renewable energy. Overall transition to a low carbon and green economy is shown to be supported and occurring with some limited success. However there is a need for further larger scale research into this area of skill formation and deployment. © 2015, ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC. All Rights reserved.},

Climate change and environmental degradation are seriously jeopardizing the future environmental and economic sustainability at the global level prompting urgent calls for a shift towards more sustainable development and greener economies. The use of the so called green jobs is a key strategy to overcome economic and ecological crisis. Aim. The present study discusses the implications for employment and decent work of green jobs in order to identify information/training measures to enhance skills of employees protecting their working conditions. Results. Despite all the emphasis laid today on the green economy, occupational health and safety (OHS) issues have still been talked only limited, as already noted in previous studies and literature reviews. Conclusion. It is needed to assess traditional and new OHS risks within green jobs in order to facilitate the transfer of OHS knowledge to green technologies as well as identifying OHS training needs.},

Green innovation generates new market prospects, products, services and processes that refine and conserve the environment. This study sought to identify the link and the influence of green innovation elements in term of enhancing environmental sustainability in the dairy products sector in Syria. The study attempts to answer the following question: Does green innovation elements have an impact on enhancing environmental sustainability in Syrian dairy products Companies. The researcher proposed two hypotheses to establish the association between the variables of the study. A practical survey sought the opinions of 60 skilled and knowledgeable personnel from three Syrian Dairy Products Companies on the subject matter. The results showed a significant correlation between the elements of green innovation combined and the enhancement of environmental sustainability in the surveyed companies. This indicates an increasing interest in the management of companies with green innovation, which will contribute to environmental sustainability. The researcher suggested that companies should collaborate with academic institutions in conducting training courses for the employees in order to raise awareness of the importance of green innovation and training them in a way that helps the company to become a green company. © 2019, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

(2011); and implications for university and work-based sustainability education, broadly conceptualised in a just transitions framework. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment was conducted using desktop policy reviews and an audit of sustainability education providers, online questionnaires to sector experts, focus groups and interviews with practitioners driving green economy initiatives. Findings: Policy monitoring and evaluation, and education for sustainable development, emerged as key change levers across nine priority areas including agriculture, energy, natural resources, water, transport and infrastructure. The competencies required to drive sustainability in these areas were clustered as technical, relational and transformational competencies for: making the case; integrated sustainable development planning; strategic adaptive management and expansive learning; working across organisational units; working across knowledge fields; capacity and organisational development; and principle-based leadership. Practitioners develop such competencies through formal higher education and short courses plus course-activated networks and “on the job” learning. Research limitations/implications: The paper adds to the literature on sustainability competencies and raises questions regarding forms of hybrid learning suitable for developing technical, relational and transformative competencies. Practical implications: A national learning needs assessment methodology and tools for customised organisational learning needs assessments are shared. Originality/value: The assessment methodology is novel in this context and the workplace-based tools, original. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The article uses the methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison, summation and abstraction as well as the mathematical and statistical processing methods. Situation analysis is based on the data of the Eurostat, specialized surveys and the results of statistical calculations. The article substantiates that in order to increase employment, efficient resource allocation and targeted economic policy focused on social problems of the country are needed, and appropriate measures for its implementation are proposed. Employment-friendly macroeconomic policy-making is seen here as a fundamental strategic guideline to address the problems of employment and social economic inequality. Green economy and green jobs’ development are one of the priority directions in increasing employment in Lithuania. Employment policy guidance in green technologies (renewable energy sources, recycling, and green building), the green economy, and promotion of professional skills in this area are recommended. Transition to green economy, eco-villages and ecological communities would be one of the fundamental directions in increasing employment among the most vulnerable groups. Furthermore, regional policies must be intensified in Lithuania to enhance economic (investment) and social attractiveness of less populated areas. © 2019, Centre of Sociological Research.

However, little research has systematically explored the key issues of GB in developing countries. This study has revealed the green technical capabilities and barriers to GB in Thailand from the perspectives of consultants, architects, and engineers, using a questionnaire survey and a case study. The results show experience in meeting the combined requirements of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the green building rating system that Thailand developed in 2010, Thailand's Rating of Energy and Environmental Sustainability (TREES), and "skilled in energy systems" to be the top two most important green technical capabilities. Barriers to GB mainly arise from financial pressure, technical limitations, and inadequate promotion. "Lack of motivations from owners" and "high initial cost" are ranked as the top two barriers to green building. The results collectively reveal that market demand and technological advancement are fundamental drivers for the GB industry, and the government, economic conditions, education, and corporate social responsibility are the other stimuli for the industry. The findings can help project participants adopt appropriate strategies to boost GB in emerging markets in developing countries. Future policies should focus on increasing market demand, encouraging green technology innovation, and reducing the cost of development and construction of GB. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Eco-innovation has been analysed from a variety of perspectives in different disciplines. However, there is a shortage of studies at a microeconomic level, especially from a management and strategic perspective. A gap has been identified in the literature for comprehensive, in-depth qualitative analyses of the dynamics of eco-innovation which take into account different firms and sectors (particularly service industry, where there is a lack of studies), in order to contribute to theory-building, considering simultaneously different levels of analysis (macro, meso and micro) and different types of agents who collaborate in the eco-innovation process. The key aim of this paper is therefore to create a strategic model of eco-innovation in order to identify and understand how and why eco-innovations are developed. A theoretical and empirical approach is provided by examining a set of eco-innovative cases from organisations in an advanced European region. To this end, a multiple-case study has been designed taking into account those gaps identified by the literature. An analytical model adapted from classical SWOT analysis has been used as a tool to obtain information on the eco-innovation process for the purposes of standardising the collection of evidence from the cases studied. A diagnosis of external and internal factors aligned with the organisation's philosophy and culture allows the strategic axes of eco-innovation to be established. The critical factors tend to be: environmental concern and regulation; knowledge and technological development, networking, and collaboration (external); and knowledge, resources and skills (internal). The strategic model contains some valuable features (it is integrating, holistic and dynamic) and provides additional knowledge of the eco-innovation process in a specific context, a regional ecosystem that plays a significant role in generating and disseminating eco-innovation. It also shows that the regional eco-innovation ecosystem appears to react by reaching outside its own confines and interacting with others to form a community of ecosystems. This model can be used to understand the particularities of eco-innovation in other regions, industrial sectors or even ecosystems.

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite the positive effects of customer capital (CC), questions remain over how managers enable CC growth by applying their skills and capabilities through managerial actions and strategies, such as developing information technology (IT) capability, fostering relationship learning (RL) activities and developing green innovation performance (GIP) with clients. These questions are especially pertinent in small and medium-sized enterprises and automotive industry companies that operate through supply chains, where knowledge about customers is likely to result from personal contact between customers and organisational members. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the extent to which these managerial actions were more likely to lead to the successful creation of CC. Design/methodology/approach: Using the partial least squares technique, this paper studies how these three managerial actions impact on CC. To do so, data from 140 companies in the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector have been used. Findings: The findings support the influence of RL on both GIP and CC. RL is a key managerial action in exploiting customer information and knowledge advantages, enabling firms to structure and reconfigure resources to produce new ways to compete and to satisfy stakeholders. In addition, results show that GIP is a determinant of CC because of its contribution to achieving sustainable competitive advantage, with GIP performing a mediating role in the relationship between RL and CC. A second contribution shows that IT is not in itself able to yield a competitive advantage, thereby validating the existence of complementary or co-focused strategic assets such as RL and GIP, which enhance IT’s influence on CC. Research limitations/implications: The authors were unable to explore the subtleties of the processes over time. Future research should include a longitudinal study. Practical implications: This study considers RL an essential factor in achieving both GIP and CC. Consequently, managers should seek to build strong RL cultures. In addition, this study shows that IT is not in itself able to yield a competitive advantage, thereby validating the existence of complementary or co-focused strategic assets such as RL and GIP. Originality/value: No study has ever examined these three antecedent variables (IT, RL and GIP) together, with the aim to examine their effects on CC. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Bearing in mind that the long-term development of the country is directed towards sustainable development, environmental protection, utilization of natural resources and effective management, we can conclude that in agriculture, and in all segments of economy, it is necessary to introduce changes. The objective of this paper is to analyze knowledge and needs of a farmer related production in accordance with current changes due to Croatian entrance of the European Union, and general knowledge and skills needed for competitive and sustainable business. A special emphasis was given on needs and capacities related to use of renewable energy sources in food production. The research showed that there is need for agricultural knowledge for farmers in order to achieve green development standards: improving the agricultural competitiveness, the quality of agricultural production and marketing of agricultural products, and conservation, protection and sustainable use of the environment. Those results can contribute in decisions on topics proposing the contents which can be expanded, thus enhance the existing high school curriculum, prepare a draft curriculum for adult training as well as for the farmers who have completed secondary vocational school. © 2016, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

The RIO +20 conference of 2012 has resulted in new momentum in addressing problems of sustainable development. However, this article argues that there are practical challenges that require paying attention to, especially those involving women. The article addressed one key question: To what extent can women participate in the transitioning process to green economy in Zambia and what opportunities and challenges exists? The study used document analysis to answer the above question. National policy documents were reviewed to understand interventions on environmental management. Whilst going through the documents, the study used gender analysis frameworks (education, skills, roles in family and society, access to infrastructure) to bring out qualitative and quantitative information on women. Using suggested green economy interventions in the literature as benchmark, qualitative analysis was used to project possible participation of women in green economy activities and possible challenges to be faced. The study found that participation of women will be limited despite existing opportunities because of challenges of access to information and communication technology infrastructures, low educational levels and skills and financial constraints. As Zambia undergoes a transitioning process, these limitations should be addressed in planned green economy policies and interventions to maximise benefits. © 2016. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

	abstract = {Does everyone have the right to benefit from science? If so, what shape should benefits take? This article exposes the inequalities involved in bioprospecting through a relatively neglected human right, the right to benefit from science (HRS). Although underexplored in the literature, it is acknowledged that market-based conservation practices, such as bioprospecting, often rely on cheap “casual” labor. In contrast to critical discourses exposing the exploitation and misappropriation of indigenous people's cultural and self-determination rights in relation to bioprospecting (i.e., biopiracy), the exploitation of a low-skilled labor force for science has been little examined from a human rights perspective. Reliance on cheap labor is not limited just to those directly involved in creating local biodiversity inventories but constitutes a whole set of other workers (cooks, porters, and logistical support staff), who contribute indirectly to the advancements of science and whose contribution is barely acknowledged, let alone financially remunerated. As precarious workers, it is difficult for laborers to use existing national and international labor laws to fight for recognition of their basic rights or easily to rely on biodiversity and environmental laws to negotiate recognition of their contribution to science. We explore to what extent the HRS can be used to encourage governments, civil society, and companies to provide basic labor and social rights to science. This should be of keen interest to geographers, who for the most part have limited engagement in human rights law, and has wider significance for those interested in exploitative labor and rights violations in the emerging bio- and green economy. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.},

We identify three key constructs related to green competences: (1) hybrid structures, (2) environmental best practices and (3) strategic flexibility, a key variable connecting structural design and green practices to organizational performance. We propose that the implementation of specific organizational structures characterized by the inclusion of market-driven control practices within hierarchies (internal hybrids) could enhance firms' environmental responsiveness and deployment of green best practices. In addition, we suggest that green practices and structures are positively related to the development of strategic flexibility, driving above-average returns in dynamic environments.

Part of the latter – which is supported by increasing environmental regulation – focuses on the development of a ‘green skills agenda’, which involves the ‘greening’ of existing occupations as well as meeting the skill needs of new environmental sectors and occupations. In this paper, we compare attempts to ‘green’ work and skills through an examination of engineering apprenticeships within the German and British steel industries. We argue that efforts to ‘green’ skills are taking place at varying degrees of intensity, mostly because of variations in institutional context. The evidence we present suggests that implementation of change is much more dynamic in the context of Coordinated Market Economies such as Germany, where development is shaped by robust VET frameworks and wider processes of environmental innovation. In contrast, within Liberal Market Economies such as the UK, there are significant barriers to the vision for and investments in skills generally, as well as those necessary for greening the labour process, with an extant development paradigm that is driven by short-term benefits and a limited focus on environmental compliance. © 2016, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Our dynamically developing market economy has, for some time now, been a witness to a growing interest in the concept of business management involving conscious activities oriented not only at financial profits and economic aspects but also at broadly understood social and ecological interests. Such an approach, termed sustainable development, is becoming an imperative in the contemporary world, hence the decision processes of entrepreneurs tend to be more and more often guided by the principles of environmental corporate responsibility. The author of the study reckons that the implementation of the above business model requires, most of all, the engagement of the human factor. Eco-oriented management is performed exclusively by employees with positive attitudes towards the environment, green competencies, and responsible for the environmental consequences of their actions. Therefore, human resource management oriented at supporting the implementation of the principles of ecological development and the development of environmentally-friendly attitudes of employees referred to as Green Human Resource Management plays an unprecedented role in environmental performance. Green Human Resource Management is a novel approach to the performance of the HR function within organizations – one where environmental contexts constitute the foundation of all initiatives. This involves the application of HR policies in order to promote the sustainable use of company resources, to support ecology and development of ecological sensitivity in workers. This is because ecological awareness of employees and managers is key to the operations of any company complying with the concept of sustainability. The purpose of the study is to present the relevance of Green Human Resource Management to the operations of contemporary companies and indicate practices which can be undertaken in the field to promote knowledge related to the subject matter and extend the scope of concept application as a tool for constructing sustainable companies. The theoretical part of the study, drafted on the basis of a world’s literature overview, identifies several environmental practices that can be employed in the field of human resource management at each stage of the personnel process, starting with work design, employee selection, work discipline shaping, to the development of “green” competencies and “green” working conditions. The empirical part of the research demonstrates the results of a questionnaire conducted at a random population of 300 Polish enterprises. The research approach used enabled the researcher to identify these initiatives in the field of Green HRM that, in the opinion of the study managers, play the key role in the process of shaping enterprise sustainable development. © 2019 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

A study was carried out to analyse existing and potential green jobs and identify green qualifications and skills necessary for the development of the GE. The study was done within the context of the role of local governments in the adoption of green economy strategies in the wastewater treatment sector, in selected local governments across the northern provinces of South Africa. A descriptive survey method with qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed for data collection from twenty-four wastewater treatment plants in eleven local municipalities. The concept of the GE was foreign to several employees, who could not identify green jobs within most sectors of the economy. Only13.5% of the employees of the surveyed plants were involved in directly green jobs. A further 36% were in green-related jobs while the remaining 50.5% were involved in non-green jobs. Barriers to the creation of green jobs and implementation of green practices were the shortage of employees with green and conventional wastewater treatment skills, and lack of training in green skills. Several opportunities for green jobs creation exist, such as the implementation of renewable energy, r e-use of treated effluent, and processing of waste sludge into compost. To spur GE growth and create green jobs, the creation of awareness, development of skills and implementation of green technologies should be intensified. © 2018, University of Cape Town.},

	abstract = {The transition towards a sustainable economy has given a new term “green competences”. Green competences build upon the foundation of core competences including literacy, numeracy, communication, teamwork and problem-solving-which along with awareness of environmental issues and entrepreneurship, facilitate lifelong learning and adaptability to environmental change (Marsden, Medhurst & Irving, 2014) [1]. Organizing experiential learning activities is not new to the learning environment in higher education institutions in the world. However, it would be a new approach to some cultures like Vietnam， where most of students are not familiar with studying in proactive and experiential ways. Experiential learning activities provide students with opportunities to self-construct their competences from experience. This article describes a brief theoretical approach to core competence and experiential learning activities (Project-Based Learning, Learning Games) for developing core competencies (problem-solving, teamwork) of technical students at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE) in Vietnam. In addition, qualitative (observation and interview) and quantitative methods were used to describe a progression of improving core competences of technical students. Finally, minor suggestions for lecturers to develop core competences of technical students through organizing experiential learning activities by carefully considering a consistency of learning outcomes, teaching-learning activities and assessment according to the “Conceive Design Implement Operation” (CDIO) approach to engineering education at HCMUTE were given. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.},

	abstract = {International projects have helped organizations around the world to better adapt to the new environmental conditions in which they operate, driven by the phenomenon of globalization. Electronic communication and information tools have enabled the creation of international virtual project teams (IVPTs), allowing team members to collaborate regardless of their geographic location or cultural, historical, socio-political, and educational differences. However, such an environment characterized by diversity will be productive only if the project team managers acknowledge and understand the behavior of influence factors comprised by the virtual environment, developing, accordingly, strategies that support team performance. In order to analyze the factors that influence IVPT performance, we used a C5.0 algorithm on the dataset through IBM SPSS Modeler software. Data collection was performed through an online survey, conducted within 107 IVPT members and managers, in order to answer the third question of the research. The predictive model created by the data mining algorithm revealed that the most important fields underlying the decision tree building were the cognitive skills training programs, team culture, and selection of IVPT members based on the characterisics of their national cultures. These results demonstrate the hypothesis that culture represents one of the most important factors influencing team performance. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Entrepreneurial programs had paid great in assisting humanity. This action changes common man the way they live apart from generating careers. Despite the significant influence of entrepreneurship towards evolving a country's economys growth these actions have its own weaknesses. Therefore, green entrepreneurs are trying to shape the behavior of doing business to emphasize the society's new concerns on environmentalism and other ecological issues as they touch their business. Recently Green entrepreneurs are being seen important parts in the transition to green economies. World evidence indicates that people are increasingly becoming concerned about the environment and are gradually changing their behaviors accordingly. Since green entrepreneurial practices by SMEs in many countries were still in nascent stage it was recommended that relevant stakeholders should put in place measures meant to spur adoption and implementation by most entities including SMEs. Consequently, this research examines the state of green entrepreneurship and explores key factors that can towards helping green entrepreneurship specifically among SMEs in Malaysia and Nigeria by means of a quantitative method. Hence, it's expected that the result of this study can pay meaningfully during policy design among government agencies answerable for environmental protection, this will encourage green entrepreneurship in Malaysia and Nigeria.

	abstract = {The organisations formulate and implement green human resource management practices to achieve competitive advantage. In green human resource management literature, green competencies has evolved to a significant construct in the recent years. The state-of-the-art literature on green human resource management considers green competencies as an essential requirement for organisation to achieve environmental performance. However, literature lacks construct development and measurement validation regarding the concept of green competencies. In this regard, the study developed a Green Competencies Scale in accordance with the Natural Resource-Based View. Initially, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify the six dimensions of the construct. Subsequently, through fifteen qualitative interviews, the authors matched the literature review with the statements of the respondents and finalised a total of forty items. Later, the Q-sort procedure was conducted to refine the results. Exploratory Factor Analysis was completed to determine the factor structure of the green competencies construct, which is comprised of six dimensions and twenty nine items. After finalising the scale, the partial least square structural equation modelling tool was tested to prove the construct's precision, which reasserted its reliability and validity. To examine the nomological validity, the direct effect of green training on green competencies was examined and the relationship was affirmed. The key finding of the study is that green competencies is a reflective, multi-dimensional scale which comprises of dimensions such as green knowledge, green skills, green abilities, green attitudes, green behaviour and green awareness. The direct relationship between green training and green competencies was evaluated. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed followed by the future scope and limitations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Globally, the construction industry is one of the main contributors to the depletion of natural resources and a major cause of unwanted side effects such as air and water pollution, solid waste, deforestation, health hazards, global warming and other negative consequences. In the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to apply technologies and methods that deliver better and more sustainable performance in a way that is cost-effective. Sustainability, adaptive and mitigative approaches to climate change, in the design of infrastructure, are therefore important steering elements [1]. A systematic and iterative analysis of the environmental impact of various design solutions is commonly suggested for infrastructure projects, but rarely happens. The lack of appropriate tools and skills for sustainable design was often quoted as a barrier to sustainable design [2]. To stay competitive and to meet upcoming stricter environmental regulations and customer requirements, designers have a key role in designing civil infrastructure so that it is environmentally sustainable. These and other factors have compelled the engineer to design with greater care and in more detail. The changing roles of engineers will be highlighted, to react to changes in climate. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of eco efficient criteria on infrastructure projects. The use of the proposed criteria would ensure a sustainable design for township infrastructure services through the consideration of scare resources, ecological sensitivity in the design and planning of infrastructure projects. This paper also gives an overview of the proposed Green Township Infrastructure Design toolkit and promotes the use of green practices on infrastructure services design that is environmentally sound, placing fewer burdens on the environment. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.},

This paper attempts to examine China's eco-innovation gains in response to the energy saving and emissions reduction (ESER) policy enforced during 2006-2010. We first construct an integrated analysis framework to evaluate the changes of energy and environmental performance used as the proxy of eco-innovation, and then the intertemporal change of China's eco-innovation gains as well as the regional differences is investigated. The results indicate that China had accelerated its process of eco-innovations during 2006-2010 when a series of ESER policies were enforced. The developments and wide adoptions of advanced energy saving and environmentally friendly technologies serve as the primary driving forces, while upgrading management skills and organizational designs contribute relatively little. Furthermore, the realizing paths of cross-region eco-innovations in China are obviously discrepant. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).},

This double call leads us to ask how can skills development best support development that is sustainable for individuals, communities and the planet, and which promotes social justice and poverty reduction. In considering this question, we critique the idea of green skills for the green economy as being inadequate for achieving a transformed and transformative VET that shifts the target from economic growth to the wellbeing of individuals and that enables vocational education to play a role in challenging and transforming society and work. Rather, we argue that we must see human development and sustainable development as inseparable, and plan and evaluate VET for its contribution to these. Such an approach must be grounded in a view of work, and hence skills for work, that is decent, life-enhancing, solidaristic, environmentally-sensitive and intergenerationally-aware. It must confront the reality that much current VET is complicit in preparing people for work that lacks some or all of these characteristics. It must be concerned with poverty, inequality and injustice and contribute to their eradication. It must be supportive of individuals' agency, whilst also reflecting a careful reading of the structures that too often constrain them. In doing all this it must minimise the costs and risks of any transformation for the poor and seek to lock them into better individual and communal lives, not out of them. Finally, it must transform skills, work and the world in ways that are truly sustainable of the people of today but also of those who are to inhabit the earth tomorrow. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Nevertheless, carmakers shall bring to the market ground breaking products. How to solve this paradox? How to invite ideas, delve deeper into the best ones, conceive ground-breaking innovations and bring them to life in realistic prototypes? Renault proposal is to enable an eco-innovation community. This community shares three pillars: a common culture, original structures and collaborative practices. This work propose to provide a feedback of these pillars implementation. A common culture arise within the Renault Creative People network. They enhance original means of emulation (temporary expositions, social networks) to reveal ideas. An original ‘think tank’ structure gather engineers, designers and customer specialists: this is the Cooperative Innovation Laboratory (LCI). Finally, two Practices support eco-innovation activities. In one hand the Collaborative Life Cycle activities (Co-LCA) framework. It counts five steps: explore, engage, elucidate, evaluate and extend. In the other hand the landing process guarantee a successful implementation in vehicle development. Three case studies are described. The first one is a concept aiming to a crazy target “zero footprint mobility”; the second is the Renault Twizy Delivery concept to tackle ‘final kilometers’ logistics and the last one is the Electric Vehicle Footprint study. Our case studies confirm the needs to create new workplaces, new tools based on social network and new skills for managers-facilitators, such as flexibility, reactivity, empathy.

	abstract = {The environmental engineering discipline has focused much of its historical efforts in developing regions of the world on advancing environmental sustainability through improving provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. However, the skills and expertise that reside within the discipline of environmental engineering are fundamental to achieve a much broader range of sustainable development goals, including those related to health, climate, water, energy, and food security; economic development; and reduction of social inequalities. Accordingly, this article critically reviews several focus areas where environmental engineering should assume a more active presence in the global community that seeks to achieve sustainability in developing regions of the world. The 10 environmental engineering Grand Challenges for the developing world covered are: (1) understand the historical perspective of the discipline's connection with public health as the field transitions forward; (2) integrate the differences encountered when operating over rural to urban locations; (3) address emissions of greenhouse gases and other important carbon-containing pollutants; (4) understand the link between development and health to better connect health outcomes and reduction in risk with ecosystem management and other development interventions; (5) address the complex interactions of water energy systems; (6) integrate the synergy inherent in development/sustainability goals of WASH, food security, and resource recovery; (7) transition to a green economy; (8) advance monitoring, evaluation, and assessment activities that include life cycle assessment, (9) integrate culture, perception, and behavior with advances in science and technology, and (10) educate globally competent engineers.

	abstract = {This is a review study on new paradigm in teacher education in TVET from policy maker perspective for some issues on how teacher/lecturer education development strategies the challenges of knowledge society and global economy. There are four objectives reflects on this study, first to appreciate the significance of global challenges in TVET educators' development second to examine the emerging issues and challenges in TVET in training and developing educators (teacher or lecturers). Third is to share innovative concepts and models in TVET educator's training and development and fourth is to promote best practices around the world in TVET educators training and development through sharing experiences. This review focus on some delegate interested studys from international and regional organizations, the government and private sectors, non-government organizations to work together in preparing TVET educators for the 21st century generation. This review found that the amalgamation experiences in TVET's from international and regional organizations are focus on fundamental frameworks which is enhancing some roles of TVET educators from insufficient transmitter of knowledge to more on development on knowledge society such learning to be reflective educator, facilitator, mentor, manager and coaching and realize the importance of generic skills, Higher Order Thinking (HOT) skills as well as green skills as fundamental components in the development of next generation TVET graduates. This review suggest that every training organization have to recognizes the growing concern for shortage of qualified or well-trained TVET teachers or lecturers and to give priority in fundamental framework in teacher/lecturer education development in TVET sector for 21st century economy. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

The development of ‘green economies’ and the transition to a low-carbon economy offers areas experiencing industrial decline an opportunity to innovate around policies for regeneration. In this process, there is a necessary emphasis on skills development and the creation of decent jobs, but institutional context mediates such processes in different places in different ways. This article argues that an effective transition policy is more likely to emerge where a mutually reciprocal relationship is developed between the state qua government and the social groups that comprise the region, including employers and workers and their representatives. Utilising a ‘varieties of capitalism’ typology in relation to areas of industrial decline in Germany and the UK, the article illustrates the ways in which transition policies are elaborated and implemented, with an explicit focus on decent job creation. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Unfortunately, gaps exist in fostering curricular and extracurricular training in science communication. We focus our article on opportunities for university- and department-level leadership to train new scientists to communicate effectively. Our motivation is threefold: (1) communication training is key to being competitive in the increasingly diverse job market, (2) training early career scientists in communication “jump-starts” personal and societal benefits, and (3) the authors represent a group of early career aquatic scientists with unique insights on the state of and need for training. We surveyed early career aquatic scientists about their science communication training experiences. In summary, survey respondents indicated that (1) science communication training is important; (2) graduate students are interested in training that is not currently available to them; (3) departments and advisors are moderately supportive of students participating in science communication, but less enthusiastic about providing training support; and (4) graduate students lack opportunities to put science communication training into practice. We recommend departments and institutions recognize the benefits of science communication training, develop a strategy to support such training, and facilitate individualized approaches to science communication. © 2016 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography},

	abstract = {This paper examines the opportunities and risks of employment, skills and education that are related to a circular economy (CE) in the United States. Combining occupational skills and education data with a newly introduced definition of CE employment, we compare circular- and non-circular-oriented occupations in terms of skills and abilities. Building on the seminal paper by Consoli et al. (2016) and looking at all occupations within a broad range of CE-related industries, we detect and address heterogeneity in job requirements within the CE. We distinguish core activities within CE employment – focusing on renewable energy, repair, re-use of materials and the sharing economy – from enabling activities, which are focused on management, design, and ICT-applicability of the CE. While core CE-activities generally require more manual and technological skills, enabling activities, in contrast, require more complex cognitive skills. Neither core nor enabling CE sectors, however, are entirely cohesive in terms of skill requirements. Part of the education and skills demand is identifiably driven by ‘circularity’, particularly with regard to technical skills for the core of the CE. This may require specific education and training programs for future development of the CE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

One area that has received significant attention is workforce development to support the education and training of workers in new knowledge and skills required to convert and maintain green enterprises. Yet many question whether the U.S. workforce development system, which has been described as fragmented and incoherent, has the capacity to respond. The Solution: The article presents findings of a comparative case study of two Energy Training Partnerships (ETPs) funded by the U.S. Department of Labor to stimulate a comprehensive workforce development strategy for green jobs in two regions. It provides new insight into the challenges and effective practices of meeting the needs of the green economy as well as improving the functioning of the U.S. workforce development system. The Stakeholders: Scholars and practitioners concerned with the effective and equitable functioning of the labor market, including human resource development, workforce development, and economic development, will be interested in this article.

	abstract = {In Malaysia there are several pressures to deliver a green technology in building industry. However, most new projects display few green building technology features, explaining the continuous presence of, and increasing problems related to, the environment in Malaysia. Green building industry in Malaysia is one of the main drivers in nation development. The Malaysian government is actively promoting policies to ensure quality and affordable houses to all nations. Thus, this scenario shows that indicator of green building is becoming prominent in Malaysian building industry. This concept was recently introduced in Malaysia; however, there is a lack of interest among industry stakeholders. Indicator of green building is the foundation of the sustainable construction development. Indicator of green building performance is redefining Building practice and Malaysia and is poised for early adoption in recondition of the potential economic and environmental benefits that accrue to it. The review focuses on identifying methods and indicators that can be adopted for the assessment of green potential. It is found that the most suitable indicators can be derived from green building rating tools with some modifications to produce evidence that can be collected and measured. This paper anticipates that apart from filling the gap in knowledge, these findings will assist the government, building industries and managers to strategize their efforts towards achieving building sustainability; based on the review papers are proposed. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the principal factors that affected Malaysian green building technology, and determine their relative importance as perceived. According to the results, the level of indicator of green building performance in Malaysia needs improvement and Based on the Green Building Index (GBI), the government plays the key role in the development of indicator of green building performance in Malaysia. The main barriers are as follows: deficiency of knowledge and skills, lack of specific rules and regulations, lack of awareness and commitment and lack of sustainability elements based on green building rating like GBI. © Research India Publications.},

As entrepreneurs require different forms of finance as their businesses grow and move up the ‘finance escalator’, we explore the role of public sector support for grant, equity, debt and new forms of crowd funding finance in higher and lower income countries. These funds can enable individual sustainability focussed businesses to access finance and encourage finance into new areas through having a demonstration effect. We conclude that a finance ecosystem approach is required that ensures complementary forms of finance for low carbon investment are connected at local, national and international scales, alongside support to build entrepreneurial skills and investment readiness. There is also a need for better evidence of the role of public sector support and where there is greatest impact on climate change. © 2018},

Environmental protective acts with adequate ecological knowledge and socio-economic behavior and skills are referred to in this paper as green competencies (GCs). However, a systematic approach for developing and understanding key factors that enhance individuals’ GCs is lacking. This study contributes to green human resource literature by integrating environmental consumer behavior literature with traditional skills and competencies literature to help firms to select the right individuals to achieve their environmental goals. Using Robert’s competencies framework and structural equation modeling, this paper empirically examines the influence of individual GCs on organizations’ green practices and performance objectives. Our model is tested using a sample of 1230 employees working in key industries in the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo. The results indicate that acquired GCs are more positively associated with individuals’ GCs and green behavior. The study empirically demonstrates that verifying acquired GC attributes such as environmental knowledge, green purchase attitude and intention during employee selection would certainly be helpful for firms to identify individual green performance potential. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

The social living leans towards chaos and exclusion - let alone the notorious digital divide - many economies have already plummeted, a high percentage of young persons belongs to the NEET (Not [[]engaged] in Education, Employment or Training) group, and so on. The solution cannot be based on ready-to-use recipes. Instead, a long-term strategy is needed to focus on: research and innovation; scientific training and education of excellence; and, therefore, development of the ensuing skills. The basis for that lies in the ability to master tools such as: scientific reasoning, probability and Bayesian statistics, mathematical logic. A task not at all easy in our country, but we should at least try. The paper shows a few meaningful examples of the so-called &quot;scientific critical thinking&quot;, increasingly required by high-tech companies, especially for the new jobs - think of big data - e.g., from ICT, smart grid, green economy and advanced manufacturing.},

The demographics of population ageing in Malaysia demand the knowledgeable, skilled and dedicated elderly caregivers. However, the main hindrance remains the shortage of trained and competent elderly caregivers in Malaysia. The problem that this study addresses is that to date research has not presented a competency framework for 21st-century job skills and green job skills for healthcare workers in the aged care industry. Therefore, the study will investigate the constructs and sub-constructs of the 21st-century job skills and green skills competency framework for elderly caregivers in the care and community services. The reason is that these skills will be needed and demand for the future human resources. The Iceberg Model by Spencer and Spencer (1993), 21st-century job skills and green job skills will be guided and presented as a conceptual framework for which this study rests.

	abstract = {The building industry has experienced a widespread transition towards green buildings and consequently a growing need for green facilities professionals to maximize green building potential in terms of energy efficiency, water conservation and waste reduction in their operational stage. Green buildings have unique technological systems that require facility managers to have relevant knowledge and skills to conduct proper facilities management and maintenance planning to maximize the potential of green buildings. It is important, then, to investigate whether knowledge gaps for facility managers exist with respect to green buildings, and if so, how these knowledge gaps could be bridged. Though several studies have investigated the operation and maintenance processes of green buildings, few studies considered facility managers’ knowledge and skills regarding green facility management (GFM). Set in the context of Singapore, this study aims to holistically investigate the knowledge and skills of managing green buildings in the community of facility managers, including their perceived differences between green and conventional buildings, the difficulty of GFM, the knowledge gaps of GFM and the underlying reasons, as well as how the gaps could be bridged. A total of 90 survey responses were collected and eight interviews with key stakeholders were conducted, which indicate facility managers believe green buildings do have special features that require unique knowledge and skills, and currently knowledge gaps do exist hindering the transition towards GFM. Therefore, this paper derives plausible solutions to bridge the knowledge gaps, such as establishing holistic subsidies for those facility managers participating in training programs of GFM. This study provides references for researchers and relevant governmental departments to better understand industry professionals’ knowledge gaps in the transitioning process towards a green built environment, and to make better policy decisions bridging the knowledge gaps and thereby facilitating the green transition process. © 2018, College Publishing.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an improved modelling approach for tessellating regular polygons in such a way that it is environmentally sustainable. In this paper, tessellation of polygons that have been innovated through the formed motifs, is an innovation from the traditional tessellations of objects and animals. The main contribution of this work is the simplification and innovating new patterns from the existing regular polygons, in which only three polygons (triangle, square and hexagon) that can freely be tessellated are used, compared to using irregular polygons or other objects. This is achieved by reducing the size of each polygon to smallest value and tessellating each of the reduced figure to the right or to left to obtain a two different designs of one unit called motif. These motifs are then combined together to form a pattern. In this innovation it is found that the proposed model is superior than tessellating ordinary regular polygon, because more designs are obtained, more colours may be obtained or introduced to give meaningful tiles or patterns. In particular Tessellations can be found in many areas of life. Art, architecture, hobbies, clothing design, including traditional wears and many other areas hold examples of tessellations found in our everyday surroundings. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews recent theoretical discussions on education for sustainable development and competence based teaching, and relates them to the international policy processes of the Sustainable Development Goals implementation where ‘the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development’ are expressed in the SDG 4.7. It shows the importance of the public debate for fostering shared understanding and acceptance of strategies for educational change within the ongoing development of Agenda 2030 at national level. The participatory involvement of multiple actors on different levels is widely recognized as a pre-requisite for consensus on long term goals, but in the Czech Republic, lack of public discussion was identified as an obstacle to deep transformation of the educational system and its reorientation towards ESD. The case study presented in this article describes participatory research conducted to reflect and support the activities of the multiple Czech actors who developed a joint Vision for education that emphasizes competences for sustainability and active citizenship. To draft the Vision and receive formative feedback on its content and wording, participatory processes were organized in several stages: an expert panel developed the first version of the document which was then consulted with representatives of other social actors in focus groups and on future search conference. Next, an overview of actors' views, preferences concerning the Vision content, and the perceived opportunities for and barriers to educational change was collected through an online survey with more than 160 respondents. This generated data for reflection of different views, and quantitative analysis of the actors' expressed preferences. Results highlighted the differences in the actors' focus and particular interests, but also showed a balance in these interests between different groups of actors so that in general, the cooperatively drafted Vision proved to be widely acceptable. In the course of this participative research, in-depth discussion with a number of civic society representatives was initiated, their specific viewpoints were confronted and critically evaluated, and new concepts of the Czech educational system discussed. The fact that the arguments were developed jointly guaranteed a common understanding across a wide range of backgrounds thus facilitating the integration of the Vision in policy debates. This method of participatory research is thus an example of sustainability science which strives for social impact in addition to scientific impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This article argues that there is an urgent need to include sustainable development aspects in teaching and learning at all levels of education. Implementing Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) poses a new challenge for teachers and teacher educators. The role of international collaboration, partnerships and networking is increasingly becoming important in creating sustainable solutions towards green economies and programmes. The post-2015 global agenda for sustainable development should recognise the need for regional and international collaborations in forging lasting strategies for a sustainable future where education for all is relevant, reliable and accessible. This article proposes a model for collaboration based on analyses conducted on a project on education for sustainable development programme involving key success factors for collaboration and focussing on the local and global stakeholders and their role in enhancing ESD among teachers. For this purpose, the four partner countries: South Africa, India, Mexico and India were examined to understand how ESD is implemented; how experiences are shared; and best practices incorporated into the programme. Local and global experts (ESD-Expert-net members) who developed an international core curriculum for teachers were involved. From the pilot, four country programmes, a conceptual model of seven levels of collaboration and partnerships for education for sustainable development to enhance teacher development among local and international partners was developed. This model is proposed to serve as a framework for education for sustainable development implementation in multinational collaborations and is discussed in relation to the post-2015 sustainable development perspective. © 2015 University of South Africa.},

	abstract = {This study aims to map out the relationships that make up green innovation initiatives in Brazilian industry. The sample comprised 100 managers at manufacturing companies, most of them operating in the business of farm machinery and equipment (45 managers) and steel structures (14 managers). To develop this study, Medeiros et al. (J Clean Prod 65:76-86, 2014) study, mapping critical factors that drive the success of green product innovation and the paradigm of complexity, was used as a reference study. Based on the results, it was possible to identify that the operational dynamic of the factors and variables that affect market success do not happen in an isolated or fragmented way; they occur systematically with different contingencies and structured basic and intermediate skills in order to meet the expectations of consumers, laws, and environmental legislation. Initially, the technological expertise factor was noted as very important for sustaining green product innovation. Furthermore, since proactive leaders are an important factor for successfully developing environmentally sustainable products, it must be added to technological expertise as the foundation for developing green innovation. After defining the basis for green product innovation, the intermediary conditions necessary for using the available technology appropriately were mapped out. In this sense, variables such as “elimination of cultural barriers,” “capacity for critical reflective analysis,” and “experimentation” are also very important. In addition, some of the variables of the cross-functional collaboration and market knowledge factors were a part of the structure that organizations need to transform potential into developing green products, which is the basis for the third level of the model. The fourth level of the model has the “meeting consumer expectations” and “following law and legislation” factors, which make up the main goals for developing environmentally sustainable products according to a number of surveys that were conducted. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

The main goal of this paper is to assess the employment benefits of investments in renewable energy in the Czech Republic. We examine the level and rate of the development of the renewable energy sector in the Czech Republic in terms of ('green‘) job creation for the period 2008–2013, in comparison to data from other EU countries, including Germany as a leading early investor in renewables. Whilst the deployment of renewable energy in the Czech Republic has succeeded to create a significant number of jobs (more than 20 000 employees in 2010), our analysis illustrates a strong dependency of job creation on the continuation of financial incentives. We also find that biomass and waste energy processing offer the highest employment per MWh, which benefits employment in (economically fragile) rural areas. We discuss the question of competitiveness of a country that was not amongst the early adopters of renewables, arguing that the technical skills of the labour force in the Czech Republic provide a potential for more sustained investments in the sector. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Human capital is considered as a totality of certain personal, social, professional and business skills, as well as an important investment resource, the use of which contributes to the efficiency of production. Considerable attention is devoted to the methodological aspects of the human capital's study. Despite the importance of the problem of productive use of human capital, the relationship of quality, motivation of personnel and efficiency of its use has not been sufficiently studied, which led to the need of a more detailed study of this issue with the use of sampling, monographic studies and statistical methods for the research of stochastic relations. The study included the following stages: analysis and assessment of the level of development of the human capital of Kazakhstan compared to the developed countries, identification of factors that influence the use of this capital and calculation of strength of their relationship; formation of proposals regarding the accumulation, effective use and further development of human capital in the agricultural sector of the economy. © Viktor Bazylevych, Galyna Kupalova, Zhanna Bulhairova, Larysa Satyr, Natalia Goncharenko, 2016.},

This quantitative study uses a quasi-experimental technique to evaluate 62 year-five primary school students: group of treatment utilising the GS Module, and the control groups without GS Module. A GS practice rubric test was conducted to measure the performance of the students after they had practised the GS. The GS practice-questionnaires were only answered by the treatment group after using the module for nine weeks. The analysis results of the t-test show that the level of GS practice between the male and female students is almost the same and at a good level. The MANOVA's findings show that there are no significant differences of the Waste practice, 3R and water usage of green skills between male and female students. These clearly shows that the practice of the two groups are at the same level and good. Conclusion, that GS can be integrated into DT subjects, and students can implement the practices related to environmental sustainability. In addition, the GS implementation inculcates positive practices among teachers and pupils, which in turn help preserve the environment for the future generations. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the share of jobs in the US that would benefit from a transition to the green economy, and presents different measures for the ease with which workers are likely to be able to move from non-green to green jobs. Using the US O*NET database and its definition of green jobs, 19.4% of US workers could currently be part of the green economy in a broad sense, although a large proportion of green employment would be ‘indirectly’ green, comprising existing jobs that are expected to be in high demand due to greening, but do not require significant changes in tasks, skills, or knowledge. Analysis of task content also shows that green jobs vary in ‘greenness’ with very few jobs only consisting of green tasks, suggesting that the term ‘green’ should be considered a continuum rather than a binary characteristic. While it is easier to transition to indirectly green rather than directly green jobs, greening is likely to involve transitions on a similar scale and scope of existing job transitions. Non-green jobs generally appear to differ from their green counterparts in only a few skill-specific aspects, suggesting that most re-training can happen on-the-job. Network analysis shows that the green economy offers a large potential for short-run growth if job transitions are strategically managed. © 2018},

This paper focuses on how internal and external knowledge sharing intercede green innovation and ponders on how it affects the organization performance. First, the empirical results show that all types of external knowledge don't convey the same green innovative outputs. Second, they reveal that the success of the innovation process is strongly impacted by the access to knowledge sources but above all by the combination of internal and external knowledge in each phase of the green innovation process. The success of green innovations unveils the organizational absorptive capacity of external knowledge and their transformation into internal skills. Eventually, the risks associated with knowledge transfer can hinder the positive relationship between green innovation and the firms' performance. It also leads to the financial failure of green innovations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Human activity that affects the environment must be designed with a proper manner to ensure that the effort to maintain good practices is achieved.

However, the scenario shows those individuals that enter the labor market without a relevant qualification is common in Malaysia. In the labor market, these individuals are considered to be low-skilled workers because they had no training prior to employment. Therefore, specific training needs to be prepared for them to increase their skills.

In popular and policy rhetoric, the growing importance of ‘green skills’ is asserted frequently. This study critically examines these claims within the context of the electronic waste management sector in the United Kingdom. Drawing on the cases of a non-profit organisation and a small private enterprise in North West England, we observe that despite government support for developing skills in e-waste, both the development and utilisation of skills remain minimal. Critically, the relatively more skill-intensive process of reuse is substantially less profitable than recycling and resource capture. The study concludes by noting that the expectations from the green economy for high-quality jobs need to be assessed within the context of similar, misplaced celebrations of previous transformations of work to avoid recycling the same promises. © 2016 The Authors.

Green employment dynamics positively correlates with local green subsidies within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, local green knowledge, and resilience to the great recession.

The motivational components and attributes were found to be in favor of Malaysia. The Wilks' lambda F-test and the standardized discriminant function coefficients, showed that there were significant differences between developers in both countries as assessed by the life-cycle cost motivations, green policies and certification, market strategy, developers expected rate of return, green tax incentive, and available green skills. However, the variables with the most predictive power in accounting for the differences were found to be within the measures of life-cycle, cost-saving motivations.

	abstract = {Nowadays climate change is amongst the most critical problems affecting the wellbeing of human beings. In Ethiopia, where the majority of the population rely on agriculture, climate change has adverse effects. In rural areas, low resilient capacity to shocks exacerbates the impacts of climate change such as production failure, which in turn enormously contributed to food insecurity. In view of this fact, this study assessed the perceptions and practices of climate change and related adaptation and mitigation strategies among farmers in the Konta Special District, Southern Ethiopia, by using a mixed research approach involving a concurrent method of data collection and analysis. Quantitative data for this study was generated from 296 randomly selected survey households; while, qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The findings of this study revealed that sample respondents recognized the occurrence climate change and its increasing adverse effects. Regarding its cause, a substantial proportion (46.8%) of the respondents perceived climate change as the wrath of God and a natural phenomenon rather than attributing it to human activities. Participants also acknowledged that anthropogenic factors such as deforestation are the major driving factors for climate change. The study found that farmers affirmatively perceive the feasibility of the majority of the strategies embraced in the Climate Resilient Green Economy initiative endorsed at national level. Understanding that climate change effects are less reversible, farmers were found to practice mitigation strategies such as afforestation, agroforestry and agricultural intensification more than adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies such as fuel conservation technologies were perceived costly and complex given the economic capacity and skill of farmers. Hence, rural and agricultural development policies should initiate context sensitive adaptation and mitigation strategies to enhance the capability of smallholders to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2019 Copyright by University of Silesia in Katowice},

	abstract = {The power sector is one of the greatest beneficiaries of private investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and project financing structures globally. South Africa has adopted a unique approach to renewable energy (RE) project finance and partnership development. This unique approach is referred to as the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). The programme is implemented through Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects. The aim of this article is to assess IPPs as a variant model of PPPs. To this end, the first objective is to determine what type of partnership IPPs constitute. The second objective is to gain an understanding of how a variant PPP model can be structured. This research is based on a qualitative research design. Data from past research studies, comprising 66 interviews and 168 interviews respectively, were triangulated with current research, including 13 interviews and a conceptual and documentary analysis. The findings of the research suggest that IPPs contribute to diversifying the country's energy mix; developing RE technology; infrastructure, local economic, and green skills development; and stimulating socio-economic development. This research is unique as the concept of hybridity or hybrid PPPs is an unexplored area in public sector management. Hybrid PPPs represent a unique approach to public-private procurement for energy partnerships. The hybrid PPP model serves public interest and is crucial to the country's energy transition. © The Social Sciences Research Society.},

In 2014, UNESCO developed a framework of the key features of learning cities, at the centre of which there are six pillars or ‘‘building blocks’’ which support sustainable development. This article focuses on the third of these pillars, ‘‘effective learning for and in the workplace’’. The author analyses a number of conditions to address this aspect in the context of ‘‘green restructuring’’ which is geared towards facilitating the sustainable development of learning cities. She argues that, at the conceptual level, an understanding of the nature of ‘‘green skills’’ (what they are) and the reasons for ‘‘green skills gaps’’ (why they exist) are essential for the processes of effective learning and strategy planning in sustainable city development. The specific focus of this article is at the policy level: the conceptualisation of partnerships between technical and vocational education and training (TVET) providers, industry, government and other stakeholders with the aim of fostering the production, dissemination and usage of knowledge for the purpose of sustainable economic development and the ‘‘greening’’ of skills. The author proposes a new model, based on the quintuple helix approach to innovation combined with a policy goals orientation framework to theorise the ways in which learning cities can foster sustainable economic growth through green skills development. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning 2018.},

Methods: The study was based on data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES: 2007-2015). This study included 46,965 individuals: 20,491 men and 26,474 women. AR was defined as having been diagnosed by a physician. Occupations were classified according to occupational characteristics and skill levels into white (chief executives, senior officials, legislators, managers, professionals, and technicians), pink (clerks, clerical support workers, services and sales workers), blue (craft and related trades workers, drivers, plant and machine operators, assemblers, elementary occupation workers), and green (skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers) categories. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of AR according to the occupational clusters by using the chi-squared test and logistic regression. Results: In the study population, 10.7% of the men and 13.5% of the women had AR. The prevalence of AR was highest among white-collar workers, followed by pink, blue, and green-collar workers. Compared to green-collar workers, among men the adjusted ORs of the blue, pink, and white-collar workers were 2.00 (95% CI 1.58-2.53), 2.46 (95% CI 1.91-3.15), and 2.78 ( 95% CI 2.20-3.51 ), respectively ; and among women were 2.45 (95% CI 1.99-3.02), 2.64 (95% CI 2.15-3.25), and 3.63 (95% CI 2.96-4.47), respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that AR prevalence is significantly associated with occupational clusters. © 2018 Japan Society for Occupational Health.},

The NEPUD concept emerged from case studies of environmental governance in entrepreneurial cities. However, little is known about the concept’s relevance for less competitive cities, especially urban centres facing profound problems associated with economic decline, social deprivation and negative external images or ‘structurally disadvantaged cities.’ This paper examines how the NEPUD has played out within two structurally disadvantaged maritime port cities in Northern Europe, Hull (UK) and Bremerhaven (Germany). Both cities face serious social and economic challenges associated with long-term industrial decline, such as high unemployment rates, low skill levels, economic peripherality, and poor external images. Nevertheless, new opportunities opened up by climate change and the green economy have prompted political actors in Hull and Bremerhaven to build new alliances between local government, business and civil society and enhance governance capacities on climate change and green urban development. Highlighting similarities and differences between these two places, the paper reveals how climate change regulations provide opportunities for certain structurally disadvantaged cities to attract ‘green jobs’ and transform their external image.},

	abstract = {Many studies have been performed to explore how firms transform from a nongreen strategy to a green one, but there is no definitive answer. Aiming to untangle this complex process in the context of the strategy and belief that being green is an important endeavor, this study details how firms implement green strategy from product diversification to innovation under the pressure of environmental regulations. Consistent with our arguments, data from Chinese listed firms reveal that environmental regulations create pressure for resources and managerial skills to be split between diversification and innovation strategies, which leads to innovation at the cost of diversification. This tension is strengthened when the firm has insufficient slack resources and faces strong environmental dynamism. Furthermore, we find that the innovation strategy increasingly substitutes the loss of the downsized diversification strategy. In addition, these effects show the differences between sectors and the dynamic change over time. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Leads by the Construction Industry Development Board Malaysia (CIDB), the government of Malaysia has establishment a technical committee and eco-label task force to create guideline for good practices in sustainable construction and green buildings and to develop eco-label accreditation scheme for construction materials. The challenges of the adoption are lack of skill and capacity, overlapping of roles among the government agencies, slow industry follows through on government programs, lack of research and innovation, and cost versus benefits in term of implementation of green technology. Finally, the way forward to accelerate the adoption are to establish green public procurement, to encourage Research and Development (R&D) in related field, to educate and change public perception and mindset, to adopt life cycle costing and Industrialised Building System (IBS) method of construction and to provide legislative and financial framework for sustainable development and green building. © 2011 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {Achieving sustainability is a great challenge for most of the Indonesian manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Remanufacturing has been considered to be a key strategy to attain sustainable manufacturing by maximising the use of old components and minimising landfill size and energy usage. However, SMEs, which are undoubtedly the engine of the Indonesian manufacturing industry, do not have adequate experience, skill, resource, technology and financial support in the remanufacturing area. This paper proposes a new concept for sustainable manufacturing assessment framework through remanufacturing strategies in Indonesian SMEs. In this sustainable manufacturing assessment framework, the existing remanufactured products are assessed using sustainable manufacturing criterion (e.g. reliability, life cycle cost, employment opportunity and greenhouse gases). This framework identifies improvement opportunities, including eco-efficiency, cleaner production and green technology to make existing remanufactured products technically, economically, environmentally and socially sustainable. The sustainability of remanufactured alternators produced by Indonesian SMEs has been assessed to validate the aforementioned sustainable manufacturing assessment framework. © 2013, Fatimah et al.; licensee Springer.},

Relatively few university courses have been developed to date that explicitly focus on the green economy, reflecting its recent origins. Here we present the lessons learned from developing and implementing a new Masters course in the green economy, at Bournemouth University in the UK. The most significant challenges were institutional barriers, such as different departmental policies and procedures and decentralised budget strategies, which inhibited the cross-departmental collaboration desired for interdisciplinarity. Uncertainty about the future development of the green economy and its value as a concept, among both teaching staff and prospective students, presented a further challenge. In addition, the development of an appropriate curriculum for green economy courses has received little attention previously. Here, we present an overview of the curriculum developed for this Masters-level course, and, based on our experience, we demonstrate how the challenges in developing such a course can successfully be overcome. © 2014 by the authors.},

Creating such offers can be sometimes based upon using eco-innovation tools that focus on the idea generation phase and ideation mechanisms that allow stakeholders to redefine problems and develop new eco-creative concepts. This paper is focused on the comparison of the ideation mechanisms during the idea generation phase of eco-innovative concepts, called the eco-ideation phase. For this, it describes a set of academic and industrial studies taking into account the different ideation mechanisms. The tests compare an adapted creativity tool with existing eco-innovation tools regarding their performances during eco-ideation phases. In a second step, additional case studies are performed with the adapted creativity tool for eco-innovation, to assess whether this performance is maintained in various contexts and with various participants (in knowledge and skills). The results showed that the use of appropriate ideation mechanisms ensures a constant rate of idea generation throughout the eco-ideation session and a wide variety of ideas generated. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

In this paper, the development of Product-Service Systems (PSS) in 10 manufacturing firms that are part of the French CAC40 Index is studied. A special effort is made to investigate the reasons and the forms of PSS development, their impact on innovation management as well as the prerequisites and limits of their implementation. The case study analysis shows the links between eco-innovation strategy and PSS development. The PSS provided by firms remain mainly basic hybrid products with product-oriented services while only a limited number of pure hybrid products with use or result-oriented services are currently being developed. Regarding the innovation management issues, eco-innovation strategy and PSS development increase the need for external skills and thus require open innovation strategies. Finally, the ability to develop PSS appears to be linked to the firms' internal learning and their position within the value chain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Economy has been largely discussed but its essence is scarcely embodied in management. Its etymology means dharmic management with the main idea of using sparingly, taking the right share. Actual economic paradigm, lifeblind and greedy, is contradictory with these dharmic aspects. Green economy and responsible practices are also showing limitations to achieve sustainability. They are not in tune with the need to reduce material throughput as expressed by the Club of Rome 40 years ago and advocated by steady state economists and degrowth movement. A sustainable paradigm of management clearly needs to affirm its responsibility towards society and recognize the central role of nature. Four sustainability principles have been scientifically defined, based on laws of Nature and Physics. In such a challenge, only spiritual values can help. Spirituality which is positively associated to individual and organizational well-being certainly brings more righteousness and altruism through life interconnectedness, vision, and compassion. It indicates the way to material reduction with values such as non-violence, non-acquisitiveness and contentment. Indian tradition prescribed the balancing of four purusharthas - dharma, artha, kama & moksha - as an ideal way of directing oneself which automatically led to an ethical life, both individually and collectively. It is perhaps time to have a re-look at this model in order to draw lessons for modern management. Even though this new paradigm seems utopian, there is a potential to empower compassionate/altruistic managers. Spirituality may strengthen managers on certain life skills such as decision making, empathy, coping with emotions and stress. A recent study has shown that students who are highly spiritual and religious have a better perception of their psychological, social and cognitive skills. This potential needs to be studied more thoroughly to identify how spirituality is creating favorable circumstances to achieve sustainability.},

Gordon Edge, director of policy at RenewableUK, the trade association for wind and marine energy, says that, although renewables have been planned for many years, the industry building them is still in its infancy. In terms of keeping the capital earned by that industry in the UK, progress seems more mixed. There is currently no major turbine manufacturer operating in the UK.},

	abstract = {The development of renewable energy producers in rural areas creates new job opportunities for the countryside population. The decentralized manner of renewable energy in small cities is one of the ways how to meet the rural and small scale energy needs in a reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable way. In 2010, the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague has finished the participation in the European IEE project RES COMPASS. In mutual cooperation, with seven partners from the Great Britain, France, Spain, Greek and Finland, the University has been involved in the extensive research concerning the impact of the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) on the future European labour market. The RES COMPASS project meets the objectives expressed by the New Skills for New Jobs Initiative of the EU and stressed also other initiatives, namely the Green Jobs Initiative, the UNEP initiative as well as the requirements of the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Organization of Employers in 2008. The RES COMPASS programme strategy was based on the implementation steps in three mutually supportive components: The first component Comparative analysis of the methods of identification of skill needs on the future labour market based on the renewable energy sources was concerned in the young generation of the today's students. The second component Career Orientation test was developed as a tool for the potential young people thinking about a future career in the emerging area of renewable energy. The third component focused on the future business opportunities for small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in the RES sector. The paper informs about findings of the third component New businesses for SMEs in the RES. Realistic possibilities of the development of SMEs appear to exist in the provision of more complex services reacting to (1) needs of more rapid renovation of the morally depreciated devices, (2) interest of inhabitants and producers in the installations of at least two different autonomous alternative energy sources, (3) creation of informal groups of users who will share various energy sources, (4) need to support the installation of energy devices with other measures - energy audits and projects.},

Often, sustainability-related concepts can seem too complicated or overwhelming, or they imply simply using less-and nothing more. At Utah State University, these ideas were incorporated in a newly designed upper-level undergraduate service-learning course, entitled Communicating Sustainability. Communicating Sustainability explored the deeper meanings of sustainability, and students learned about their own beliefs and behaviors, their community, and how to act as professional change agents. The course was structured around exploring the theoretical foundations of sustainability, communication and conservation theories, and communication techniques. Students then used knowledge gained, theories, and techniques to foster pro-environmental change with community partners. The course relayed concepts of sustainability in a positive light and gave undergraduate students real-world experience of working in a sustainability- related profession. As the demand for green jobs continues to increase, this article provides a framework for using a Communicating Sustainability class to help students develop life skills and effectively transition into professionals.},

Data from three different but complementary studies provide powerful insight into the attitudes and perceptions of young people who are studying, or are recent graduates of, Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) programs. We argue that the voices of the young people who participate as students are largely absent from analysis and policy-making, despite policy rhetoric about a demand driven Australian tertiary education sector responsive to consumer (student) interest and need. The combination of these three studies contributes to an improved understanding of what these young adults think and are learning with regard to skills for sustainability in their VET courses and in their workplaces. Most notably, these VET students reported that increasingly changes around skills for sustainability are being implemented into both their work roles and their courses of study. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.},

	abstract = {Professional plumbers play an essential role in the implementation of water efficiency. If North America is to achieve high water efficiency standards and more ambitious plumbing codes, plumbers will need to be actively included in the water efficiency discussion. Repositioning the industry will required a cultural shift because the plumbing community has been mostly ignored in discussions of the larger environmental agenda and priorities. This repositioning will require substantial rethinking and retraining. New knowledge will need to be transmitted about emerging water efficient technologies, public policies and practices, as well as the rationale for use in residential and Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional (ICI) sectors. The GreenPlumbers Program (GPP) initiated this knowledge transfer process. Originating in Australia and expanded to the United States, the GPP is a national training and accreditation program for professional plumbers. Their focus has been on upgrading skills and awareness of water efficiency, conservation, and the professional plumbers' roles in the contemporary environmental context. In this paper we report on the efficacy of the GPP's curriculum and the process of transferring explicit water efficiency knowledge. Semi-structured interviews and a survey were used to gather the data. We considered how the program participants incorporated the GPP curriculum into their 'day-to-day' practices and operations post-certification. We also investigated participants' motivating factors and cross-referenced these findings to their overall assessment of the program. Recommendations focus on how the GPP can best influence and contribute to a more comprehensive water efficiency agenda. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {It is well known that "green" principles and strategies have become vital for companies as the public awareness increased against their environmental impacts. A company's environmental performance is not only related to the company's inner environmental efforts, but also it is affected by the suppliers' environmental performance and image. For industries, environmentally responsible manufacturing, return flows, and related processes require green supply chain (GSC) and accompanying suppliers with environmental/green competencies. During recent years, how to determine suitable and green suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. Therefore this paper examines GSC management (GSCM) and GSCM capability dimensions to propose an evaluation framework for green suppliers. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. The identified components are integrated into a novel hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model combines the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), the Analytical Network Process (ANP), and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy context. A case study is proposed for green supplier evaluation in a specific company, namely Ford Otosan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Empirical evidence is presented on the basis of case studies and firm data including a telephone survey from German industry. The main result is that the transition from end-of-pipe technologies to cleaner production leads to a net creation of jobs, which is however restricted to a only small number of firms and to the group of highly skilled labour. Eco-innovations, like other innovations, are non-neutral. The demand for skilled and highly skilled labour rises while the demand for unskilled labour decreases. Synergies between environmental, labour market and innovation policy are apparent but they are however small and specific. The exploitation of these synergies requires the design of specific policy programmes differentiating between types of eco-innovation. The promotion of product-integrated environmental measures should be more successful if new products complement older ones, while process-integrated environmental measures should be more successful if consumers' demand is more price elastic.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to review the policy literature on green jobs and green jobs training in the USA and to present findings of a qualitative study on the start-up of two Energy Training Partnerships (ETP) funded by the US Department of Labour to train workers for green jobs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a review of the policy literature, document reviews, and interviews with administrators, employers, educators, workforce officials. The literature presumes green jobs training will help create jobs and that these jobs will provide opportunities for the poor. This study examined these propositions within the context of the ETPs. Findings: Stakeholders faced challenges related to a misaligned infrastructure, lack of synchronization in the labour market, and workforce gaps. They responded by coordinating available resources in innovative ways. Though many policy propositions were confirmed, the premise that green jobs are a pathway of poverty was not. Entry requirements were high and programmes lacked funds for long-term education. Research limitations/implications: Because the sample was small and little was known about the nature of emerging jobs, more research is needed on green jobs and their skill requirements. Practical implications: The study found that coordination on the policy and programme levels helped stakeholders respond to challenges. Also, new opportunities for the poor may be realized by embedding short-term training in a broad continuum of education and strategically linking both to economic development activities. Originality/value: Little is known about how training aligns with emerging industries. This study helped fill this gap by examining how stakeholders responded to the demands of the green sector. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study analyses how one Victorian regional TAFE Institute is working towards understanding and contributing to skill formation for the green economy. While we already know that the provision of vocational education and training in regional areas contributes to regional innovation and development (Kilpatrick, Johns and Rosenblatt, 2000; Gelade and Fox, 2008; Kearns, Bowman and Garlick, 2008; TAFE Directors Australia, 2011), this research provides a case study of how this is occurring with regard to the development of green skills. The study presents the perceptions and understandings of participants drawn from four different cohorts. These cohorts are: (1) key players in the community/industry representatives; (2) TAFE managers; (3) TAFE teachers; and (4) TAFE students. The study found that work and jobs are changing to become more sustainable though investment in large scale alternative energy generation while often lauded had failed to reach fruition. Likewise, VET training programs are also changing with teachers and students contributing to the complex arrangements around the supply and demand for green skills. The teachers at this regional TAFE who participated in the study reported that they were well supported in accessing and participating in relevant sustainability-related professional development. Finally, numerous examples were evident throughout the study of how the work performed by staff at this TAFE institute was contributing towards regional and community development. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.},

	abstract = {UK, along with many other developed countries, is now considered to be primarily a knowledge economy. According to this model, future prosperity will depend on the development of knowledge-intensive, high value-added economic activities, and on a highly skilled workforce. At the same time, the development of the green economy has recently moved towards the centre of political discourse, stimulated by current economic and environmental crises. A number of parallels are evident between the concepts of the knowledge economy and the green economy: both are currently the focus of government policy initiatives, but both are characterised by uncertainty regarding how they should be defined and implemented. This paper first examines these definitions, and then explores their potential interface. Lessons are identified for development of the green economy from recent research into the functioning of the knowledge economy. This reflects the reality that in countries such as UK, development of a green economy will largely represent the greening of the knowledge economy. How this might be achieved in practice is explored with reference to a case study currently underway in the county of Dorset, England. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine the green innovation literature using a conceptual framework developed to explain the driving forces behind environmental cooperative activities of firms. The framework links motivations to the different type of partners in the context of environmental innovations. Literature on innovation, environmental innovation, sustainable development and strategic management is examined in order to build the conceptual framework. This paper suggests that firms cooperate with governmental agencies, NGOs, suppliers, customers and industry associations to comply with environmental laws and regulation, obtain legitimacy as well as acquire competency (i.e. access to resources such as funds, knowledge and skills). However, only competencyoriented motivation stimulates organisations to cooperate with competitors and knowledge leaders. The model developed is conceptual and qualitative in nature. More research that is empirical needs to be conducted to test for the validity of the six formulated propositions. The significance of this paper is twofold. First, it integrates two different strategic management theories: resourcebased and institutional theories in explaining cooperative environmental motivations. Second, it develops a framework that provides a basis for more theoretical and empirical studies. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Graduates of the program work directly in arboriculture, ecological restoration, landscape design, and horticulture. Despite the well-documented benefits of nature on individual socio-psychological well-being, scant research has investigated the effects of working professionally in urban natural resources management. Our findings reveal the significant challenges facing training program graduates and their supervisors, but also the benefits of urban conservation job training and employment that are potentially transformational for these economically disadvantaged young adults. Green job training and employment present real opportunities for intellectual stimulation and an increased sense of accomplishment, due in part to the uniqueness of environmental work.

Organizers claim that the Solar Decathlon experience provides students with an unparalleled and transformative educational opportunity that consolidates student knowledge, builds their character, and prepares them for leadership in the green economy. Yet, despite growing worldwide appreciation for the Solar Decathlon learning experience, the specific learning and the mechanisms through which this learning is delivered have still to be characterized and explained. This study arose from witnessing firsthand the struggles faced by a Solar Decathlon team when collaborating across disciplines, and how they moved toward successful integration and completion of the project. The study centered on interviewing 24 students who participated in the design, construction, and operation of a house for a 2010 Solar Decathlon event. Questions were aimed at understanding their learning and learning process, particularly in relation to interdisciplinary collaboration. Examination of responses suggests that though the learning process entailed associated cycles of conflict and resolution, students developed a number of individual and collective competencies. Interpretation indicates that the difficulty of the process was instrumental for acquisition of interdisciplinary competencies. These skills contribute to overall sustainability competence and match those identified by industry leaders as essential for leadership in the global economy. The study concludes that the Solar Decathlon experience offers students the opportunity to develop the range of competencies needed to help society's shift to a green economy and lead it to a more sustainable future.},

The transition from conventional practices to green practices in homebuilding requires firms to acquire new skills and knowledge to meet market demand. While many of the skills required to offer 'green' building services are similar to existing skill sets in the AEC industry, the additional complexity causes a significant degree of uncertainty among homebuilding industry professionals AND educational stakeholders.As part of a U.S. Department of Labor green jobs training grant targeted toward regional energy-efficiency building services, the authors developed a research model for better understanding the needs of green building training in Southwest Virginia. The research team chose to assess green jobs through the experiences of those on the front line of these practices, employers and employees of firms in the homebuilding industry, including those in the offering of green services. The information acquired through this process illuminates several issues with existing education and training programs that influence green building practices, and the impact of these issues on providing effective green skills training to workers in the construction industry. The goal of an improved training system for green building occupations is to create an educational system that could substantially mitigate many of these perceived risks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {It is globally acknowledged that there is a growing need for co ordination of design, sustainability, economic and environmental requirements of infrastructure projects. The provision of civil infrastructure plays a major role on the natural environment and on the quality of life. The lack of appropriate tools and skills for sustainable design is often quoted as a barrier to sustainable design Richardson et al. (Design and Sustainability: A Scoping Report for the Sustainable Design Forum, 2005). A systematic and iterative analysis of the environmental impact of various design solutions is commonly suggested for infrastructure projects, but rarely happens. In order to stay competitive and to meet upcoming stricter environmental regulations and customer requirements, designers have a key role in designing civil infrastructure so that it is environmentally sustainable. These and other factors have compelled the engineer to design with greater care and in more detail. The changing roles of engineers will be highlighted, in order to react to changes in climate. In the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to apply technologies and methods that deliver better and more sustainable performance in a way that is cost effective. Sustainability, adaptive and mitigative approaches to climate change, in the design of infrastructure are therefore important steering elements (FIDIC, State of the World Infrastructure Report 2009). This paper discusses the application of 'green technology' on infrastructure design projects. It gives an overview of the proposed Green Township Infrastructure Design Toolkit and looks at a number of recommended green practices on infrastructure services design, that are environmentally sound, placing fewer burdens on the environment. The use of the proposed model would ensure a sustainable design of township infrastructure services through the consideration of scare resources and ecological sensitivity in the design and planning of infrastructure projects. © 2013 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {A potential conflict has emerged between the desire to achieve ecological sustainability on the one hand and full employment on the other. The conflict exists because of the incongruent prescriptions being advised to resolve both problems - a reduced, if not zero, growth rate in the case of ecological sustainability, and a high growth rate in the case of full employment. Very little work has been undertaken to address this crucial issue and no forum specifically exists to deal with it. That is, until now, with the establishment of IJEWE. Its foremost aim is to reconcile the potential conflict between the sustainability and full employment objectives and to find ways to establish sustainable, equitable, and efficient economies. In dealing with this conflict, many other issues emerge - namely, the impact of the sustainability objective on industry structure, on forms of employment, on skills formation, on the workplace and workplace relations, on the development of ‘green’ technologies, on competitive advantage, and on corporate management strategies. Addressing these issues is a secondary but no less important aim of IJEWE. But all the above issues need to be tackled on the understanding that economic systems are subsystems of the natural environment upon which they depend; that systems of all types are subject to various physical laws and coevolutionary principles; and human well-being is dependent upon the adequate satisfaction of lower- and higher-order needs. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Their remit is to promote the required competencies to achieve that aim, including competencies in sustainability. This article describes the role that the universities in Spain are fulfilling with respect to these issues and presents a training proposal that comprises four key competencies in sustainability with their corresponding performance indicators that permit the evaluation of different levels of achievement in training processes. These competencies must embrace their formative role not only with regard to future graduates who will be employed in "green jobs" per se, but also with regard to those alumni who will work in all the other productive sectors, in addition to all citizens directly and indirectly involved in the wider economy as consumers, producers and (direct or indirect) recipients of its effects. The proposal is based on the recommendations of the Conferencia de Rectores de Universidades Españolas (CRUE: Conference of Chancellors of Spanish Universities), and can be adapted to the teaching programs of different subjects in order to facilitate the training necessary in general competencies of sustainability within the ambit of the subjects taught. Furthermore, this proposal follows the institutional strategy of CRUE to promote curricula sustainability through the inclusion of the principles and values of sustainable development in every degree and educational program taught. This proposal could also be applied to other cultural contexts with similar characteristics. © 2014 by the authors.},

It shows how many innovative firms operate within regional networks, cooperating and interacting not only with other firms such as suppliers, customers and competitors, but also with research and technology resource organizations, innovation support agencies, venture capital funds, and local and regional government bodies. The paper argues that within the region there is the presence of various renewable energy production platforms, usually based on core technologies (wind, solar, biomass, marine, etc.) at different levels of development. They involve a mix of established energy utilities and new sustainable energy businesses that are positioned at different levels within the renewable energy supply chain. The research shows that the regional government is playing an important role in supporting the renewable energy industry; nevertheless, more needs to be done to facilitate planning control, provide skills and create new demands for renewable energy that will further foster business growth and further strengthen the existing manufacturing base and innovation in Wales. The paper identifies some weaknesses in the Welsh energy innovation system, not least that energy is not a devolved responsibility and it argues that there is some scope for the Welsh Assembly Government to further investigate gaps within the green innovation supply chain and act on strengthening regional capabilities within the industry but also to support and investigate further opportunities for inward investment. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This important mediating role is currently in high (unmet) demand in many English-speaking countries and thus more people need to be trained for this role. To determine the educational and/or training needs of a BA we conducted a survey in the Information and Communication Technology industry in Australia. The survey items are based on prior studies of information systems educational requirements and the internationally-developed Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) that has been endorsed by the Australian Computer Society. From the literature we identified three types of skills: soft, business and technical. With the increasing importance of GreenIT and the pivotal role that the BA could play in green decision making, we added a fourth type of skill: green. The survey considers 85 skills, their importance, the level of attainment of that skill, skill gaps and types of skills. Results show that all soft skills were considered to be important with the smallest knowledge gaps. Selected business skills and green skills were seen to be important. Technical skills were considered less important, but also where the largest knowledge gaps existed. Further we asked respondents whether each skill should be acquired via an undergraduate or postgraduate degree and/or industry training and experience. We found that the workplace was considered the most appropriate place to acquire and/or develop all skills, except the ability to innovate. While we found that softskills should be taught almost equally at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, business and green skills were more appropriate in a postgraduate degree. In contrast, technical skills were best acquired in an undergraduate program of study.},

	abstract = {The pursuit of so-called "green jobs" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. "Climate-proofing" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a "just transition." Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.},

In this milieu the uncongenial conventional mineral-oil based lubricants, causing adverse environmental impacts, can efficaciously be replaced by biodegradable vegetable oil based biolubricants. This article presents successful utilization of waste cooking oil (WCO) to synthesize biolubricant using a biocatalytic route. The developed methodology includes a two-step process of enzymatic (Candida rugosa) hydrolysis of WCO to free fatty acids (FFA), followed by biocatalytic (Novozyme 435) esterification of FFA with octanol in a solvent-free system to produce the octyl esters (desired biolubricant components). A classical method of parametric study was employed to explore the effect of different physico-chemical parameters on the esterification reaction. The reaction conditions to achieve maximum conversion (95%) in minimum time were, initial water content = 0.5 wt % of FFA, octanol: FFA molar ratio = 3:1, catalyst = 5 wt % of FFA and temperature = 60°C. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy confirmed that the product formed was ester. WCO thus serves as an alternative feedstock for biolubricant synthesis and additionally aids up in skillful waste minimization and reuse. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {There are pressures to adopt sustainable behaviour more so in generating profits and benefiting the society to accelerate green efforts through a green framework. The overarching goal of the paper is premised through various works of literature, building the ecosystem the elements highlighted by most researchers in the field of environmental entrepreneurship. The various models reviewed consists of generic incubators and entrepreneurship, and societal and environmental factors. Environmental entrepreneurship is often used interchangeably with concepts such as green entrepreneurship and ecopreneurship which under-researched globally, with non-existent efforts on the applicability and modelling of key environmental entrepreneurship within a specific context utilising the system dynamics approach. In order to assess the environmental entrepreneurship ecosystem, the authors adopted a system dynamic approach to determine key variables that enable the development of the system. A literature review was conducted, and of the 135 articles reviewed, n=92 peer-reviewed articles met the criteria that the researchers set. Some of the results emanating from a systematic review are environmental policy, green skills, financial and non-financial support, societal and behavioural factors, environmental agility, ethics and governance, and access to markets. The theoretical results are simulated using system dynamics modelling. Due to limited research on the above-mentioned topic, a possible impacting variable (Exogenous variables) was broadened to add value to, and have an impact on, the study. Upon reviewing the above-mentioned models, the framework emerged signalling elements to be simulated in the system dynamics model, which were then theoretically contextualised for the South African context. The theoretical virtual system dynamic model forming part of the framework will be tested and validated in the next study. The applicability of the theoretical ecosystem to South African context as well as future recommendations are provided in the study. © 2021 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Environmental awareness as a strong predictor in influencing students' green skills preparation to meet the demands of skills required in the green industry. It is undeniable that employers nowadays prefer workers who possess environmentally friendly skills to promote awareness of sustainable development in various aspects of life, such as the environment, social, and economic domains. This article aims to explore how to build a sustainable future by examining the relationship between environmental awareness and the development of work-related abilities (green skills) based on existing literature. The method used is a literature review of published articles from various academic databases such as Google Scholar, Emerald, ScienceDirect, Elsevier, Scopus, and ResearchGate. Findings from the literature review indicate that environmental awareness has a strong correlation with the formation of green skills, particularly in energy, communication, leadership, waste management, and management skills. Contributions from educational institutions are needed to generate policies that stimulate environmental awareness among students, thereby fostering the development of environmentally friendly skills.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The drivers of eco-innovation (EI) have been the focus of much research in the past. Some of these drivers have been external to the firm, such as regulation, whereas others have been internal, including its resources and capabilities and its environmental strategy. However, the analysis of the impact of those drivers on EI has too often been carried out as if they were separated from each other. In reality, the EI drivers are likely to interact. This paper tries to cover this gap in the literature using a holistic and integrated approach. Survey data from 97 chemical firms were analyzed using partial least squares to determine the critical drivers of EI and their interconnections. Our results indicate that, in fact, the impact of some drivers might not be direct but is mediated by their influence on other drivers. This is the case with environmental collaboration, environmental knowledge, green skills, consumer pressure, and export behavior, which have an indirect effect on EI through their impact on environmental strategies. Therefore, our results suggest that environmental strategy is a central mediator and a powerful driver for the entire model. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

The purpose of research is how green skills implementation through the project citizen model. The method used is Classroom Action Research (CAR). The subjects of the study were students of SMK Muhammadiyah Palangka Raya and SMKN 1 Palangka Raya in class XI. The results of this study indicate that the planning carried out in this study is to sort waste according to the type of waste. Another thing when implementing is the need for deeper explanation to students in identifying green skills problems, explaining solutions in applying green skills, and efforts to apply green skills to students when practicing in a laboratory or workshop. In this study an increase in green skills in the aspects of the ability to sort waste, the ability to analyze costs, and the ability to process products that will be made with used waste. This can be seen from the results that have been described where from each cycle from cycle I to cycle III increased in aspects of waste management with a score of 82 (good), the ability to make products from used mate-rials with a score of 3.7 (very good) and the ability to analyze the production costs of the product to be made with a score of 3.70 (very good) related to green skills in students practicum in vocational education.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The chapter explores some of the central ideas to clarify the contested nature of green economy and green jobs and how this underpins framing an appropriate green skills response. Through our work we have surfaced that central to working with understandings of green jobs are systems of occupational classification as they often govern occupational and skills provisioning. This chapter shows how central to the challenges experienced with green skills research in South Africa is the meagre representation of environmental occupations at intermediate and elementary skill levels in occupational systems. Furthermore environmental occupations appear scattered and are not visible across levels of skill. Moreover, green skills are a socially constructed concept, intangible and often unobservable. A demand-led approach to green skills has not worked because employers are unable to effectively articulate their skill needs to skills delivery bodies. This has methodological implications for how green skills research is designed and structured and who the central actors are. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

We draw on existing literature and research to highlight the connections between brain health, environmental factors and green skills. Environmental factors and exposome can have long-lasting adverse effects on brain health, particularly in vulnerable populations. Investing in green brain capital can prepare societies to address global crises. Green skills, including creativity, ecological intelligence and digital literacy, are critical for promoting sustainable environments. Access to nature improves brain and mental health, and interdisciplinary fields such as neurourbanism can inform urban planning to benefit citizens' well-being. Building brain capital and environmental sustainability interactions requires increasing future generations' awareness, education and training. A comprehensive approach to green brain capital can enable greater societal scaling, synergistically protecting brain health and environmental sustainability. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of research undertaken by the Next Tourism Generation Alliance (NTGA) project in Wales evidencing sustainability skills gaps. Survey data collected from five tourism sectors, accommodation, food and beverage, destination management, visitor attractions, travel agents and tour operators, show that the highest green and social skills gaps were identified in food and beverage businesses, whilst accommodation reported the lowest skills gaps. The effect of the type of tourism sector, business size and job level on green skills gaps perceptions was found to be insignificant, which indicates that training in sustainability skills is considered important regardless of these variables. The effect of type of tourism activity on perceptions of social skills gaps including personal and communication was significant. Addressing skills gaps is crucial given the significance of the industry in the national economy and the need for recovery from COVID‐19. Tourism is one of the worst affected industries in the pandemic, and global market research and policy guidance highlight the importance of sustainable tourism development to ensure a resilient recovery. © 2021 by the authors.

Green investments are most effective in communities whose workers have the appropriate “green” skills. We then provide new evidence on the skills requirements of both green and brown occupations, as well as from occupations at risk of job losses due to COVID-19, to illustrate which workers are most likely to benefit from a pandemic-related green stimulus. We find similarities between some energy sector workers and green jobs, but a poor match between green jobs and occupations at risk due to COVID-19.

	abstract = {This study discusses the additional concept of Green Skills, with the aim of forming more competent workers in an industry that currently demands green jobs. So, it is necessary to have stages of competency formation in developing students' cognitive abilities to become green employees who are environmentally friendly and care about the environment. Until now, only a few studies have guided and revealed the needs of the community in meeting the demands of green skills, especially in Vocational High Schools. This paper uses a literature review-based methodology to identify Green Skills and formulate cycle stages that shape student competencies. It was found that from the results of a literature study on green skills competencies to realize in school, it is necessary to have a special application model in vocational schools into learning, so that a concept known as 6R is found competence to reuse, recycle, reduce, repair, reassemble, and resaving energy. To make realistic creative TVET innovations according to the needs of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 based on green skills materials through virtual technology based on virtual reality. To diffuse creative TVET innovations into the community TVET Institutions, Government through the policy of infusion of green skills learning into the curriculum, Society, and Stake Holders can be done by joining Green Leaders Indonesia (GLI), GLI is a movement of young Indonesians to bring together and encourage collaboration between activists of the environmental care movement, green technology developers, stakeholders, government, and leaders of the ministry of the environment to create environmentally friendly solutions. Therefore well the aim of the movement having a better impact on the current environmental damage phenomenon. It is no stranger that environmental problems have become a classic problem in Indonesia, especially in TVET. The six main requirements above will be fulfilled if they are supported by the Vocational Education objectives in training green skills to form green employe. The novelty of this research is that there are six main requirements in the application of green skills with conditions that are supported by the goal of Vocational Education to form green employees.  © 2023 Author(s).},

This study aims to examine the impact of green human resource (GHR) competency mechanisms to strengthen the relationship between green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and environmental performance (EP). Using the proposed model, the present study developed a quantitative method for obtaining data from listed O&G companies in the UAE between December 2018 and May 2019. A total of 254 questionnaires were used for the analysis. There was a significant moderating effect between EP and GSCM, with GHR competency mechanisms decreasing the occurrence of negative environmental impacts associated with O&G operations. The findings will enable HR managers to align green skills with EP in UAE petroleum companies. © 2023 MDI.},

	abstract = {Purpose: An extant literature review of hospitality manpower performance reveals the scarcity of green skills among young graduates of hospitality management in the Asian context. Studies signal the discrepancy between knowledge imbibed and skills acquired. The current study is a call to action to identify the barriers to green training at the academic level. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a qualitative investigation by senior academics from Asian countries. Thematic analysis is the primary method deployed. Findings: Four major themes emerged from the analytical exercise. They include lack of resources, policies and regulations, an overburdened curriculum and awareness. Interestingly, the themes are in tandem with the Tourism Education Futures Institute (TEFI) value framework for nurturing sustainability practices in the hospitality industry through systematic programming of hotel management education. Practical implications: In order to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2030 (Goal 4) of ensuring lifelong strategic education to foster sustainability, the green skill–knowledge gap must be bridged at the academic level. The current paper sheds light on how the synergy between industry and academia can address this knowledge–skill gap and develop sustainable capacities in the long run. Originality/value: This study used a qualitative dataset, and the findings contribute to the sustainability literature. Further studies can be undertaken using big data in varied settings. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results reveal serious gaps in green skills among tourism employees in Bulgaria, which need to be addressed by relevant and regular training. A comparison of the five tourism subsectors show that representatives from the food and beverage (F&B) subsector have a completely different attitude about green skills related to current and future needs. Still, the tourism subsector type was not shown to influence the absolute gaps between the current and required future skills level. Furthermore, as a whole, company size was not shown to be a predictor of the variation in respondents' answers. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

This study will also identify the needed level technology competency of green skills in 4IR towards TVET teacher trainee from the perspective of educator. A total of 154 teacher trainees and 44 educators were selected as samples by using disproportionate stratified random technique. The questionnaire has been developed and adapted from the Model of Green Skills Competency by Pavlova and Skills in 4IR consists of 8 indicators. Mean score and standard deviation for statistical measurement were used to report the findings. Findings from the analysis show that the readiness level technology competency of green skill in 4IR amongst TVET teacher trainee are at a moderate level. However, the needed level technology competency of green skills in 4IR towards TVET teacher trainee from the perspective of educator are at high level. This shows that technology competency of green skills is important to teacher trainee in order to face the challenge of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Findings from this study will benefit Institute of Teacher Education and Ministry of Education in order to prepare teacher trainees as well as in-service teachers with technology green skills so that our Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved and equip themselves in a way of Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The interview data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo. The findings showed that generic green skills are additional skills which complement existing generic skills and focus on conserving and maintaining the quality of the environment. Pertaining to that, embedding generic green skills in teaching and learning activities can be carried out through the ingenuous use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) which involves digital skill, internet technology and electricity saving consumption.

The purpose of this research is explore the elements of green innovative skills that are considered for integration in building construction courses at technical colleges for economic sustainability in Nigeria. In this study, Data was collected using quantitative approach using a sample of 308 respondents. The identified elements were analysed via descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and Exploratory Factor analysis (EFA) which will greatly contribute to the body of knowledge. For the EFA, the recommended assumption were duly met and was conducted to test the factorial validity (construct) and to eliminate poor variables if found (observed variables) with a view to increasing the probability of Goodness-of-Fit for the results. In this analysis “Principal component analysis (PCA)” was the extraction method, “Varimax” was selected for factor rotation.In testing the construct validity; correlation matrix (>.3 and <.9) was calculated to confirm the inter-item correlation; “Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin KMO of (>.5) and anti-image correlations AIs diagonals' value of (>.5) were computed to test the sampling adequacy. “Barltts';s test” (Significant at 0.000) was conducted to test whether the correlation between the variables are sufficiently large for factor analysis; and “communalities” were calculated to test the proportion of common variance within variables; and the percentage of the total variance explained (> 60%) were computed and shown. The findings for this study includeability to;plug into different networks across the globe and identify the nature of a problem your product or service will be solving.

	abstract = {Achieving a just transition to a low carbon economy and society, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, is arguably one of the greatest policy challenges facing governments. It is also of deep concern to businesses, employees and the organisations that represent them. Much of the focus, particularly at policy level, has been on the potential of this transition to create new jobs especially through the growth of renewable energy and clean technology. In this paper, we argue that this focus on ‘green jobs', and in particular new green jobs, grossly underestimates the skills needs of a future workforce able to deliver a transition to a more sustainable low-carbon economy. The focus of this study is to gain an understanding of what skills are required to support the transition beyond these sectors. It critically reports on the results of a series of in-depth interviews with senior managers in key organisations within Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK. It sheds a light on the significant employment transitions taking place in organisations who are not specifically focused on delivering ‘green’ products or services. It finds widespread acknowledgement of the importance of a green recovery, albeit predicated by economic growth. The key skills needs reported, at all levels were likely to be ‘soft’ transferrable skills rather than ‘hard’ technical skills. COVID-19 was recognised as both a disrupter and as a catalyst for a green transition. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Generic skills are complementary to technical skills that enable potential employees to secure a place in the job market. A myriad of studies have been conducted on generic skills, and in Malaysia’s ‘greening’ development process, generic green skills have begun to attract many academics and industry players. This paper reviews several articles on generic green skills associated with the green technology industry. Document analysis was conducted to scrutinise initial information extracted from electronic databases viz Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Science Direct, Academia and EBCOHost. The findings showed that endeavours to acquire sustainable development in Malaysia are flourishing and prolific. Government agencies were seen as playing a notable role in strengthening generic green skills among employees in the green technology industry alongside international organisations and regional partners to ensure that development is compatible with maintaining the quality of the environment. In the near future, generic green skills are expected to receive solemn attention from academics and researchers, as well as become key criteria by employers in hiring new employees. Hence, further studies are needed to refine the generic green skills in balancing the development process with environmental sustainability. © BEIESP.},

Hence, to address the research gap, this study follows the steps proposed by Tranfield et al. (2003). The major part of the study comprises descriptive analysis and thematic analysis. Descriptive analysis of the selected 66 articles was examined with the classification framework, which contains year-wise distribution, journal-wise distribution, the focus of the concept, the economic sector, and dimensions of sustainable development. The paper conducts a thematic analysis of the following research questions. What are the green competencies and their conceptual definition? What are their dimensions? Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies a systematic literature review of green competencies literature, extends the state-of-the-art using the natural resource-based view, and discusses future research directions for academicians and practitioners. Findings: In recent years, there was considerable interest in green competencies (GC), as reflected in the surge of articles published in this genre. This paper asserts that green competencies are a multidimensional construct comprised of green knowledge, green skills, green abilities, green attitudes, green behaviours, and green awareness. Originality/value: Despite the significance of green competencies, there has been a dearth of study to define the constructs and identify the dimensions. Hence, this study addresses the literature gap by conceptualisation and discusses dimensions of the construct. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Students of agricultural vocational school as prospective workers have to hold these skills. This study was designed to identify students' green skills in agricultural vocational secondary schools at study program of agricultural food processing technology. Five aspects that make up green skills based on past research were examined in this study. Data were collected through a set of questionnaires intended to gauge perceptions involving 195 students from different agricultural vocational schools in West Java Province, Indonesia. The result revealed that mean score for overall green skills was fair enough. However, it needs to be increased to produce competitive graduates in accordance with employer needs. Moreover, three aspects of green skills, namely management of waste, communication skills and innovation skills to respond green challenges are lower than the mean score. Findings of this study are the initial step in describing green skills of agricultural vocational students due to the limitations of this related research. More studies should be conducted to better understand and stimulate the integration of green skills into agricultural vocational curriculum to improve students' green skills. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Following negotiations, OECD members resolved to heighten and support innovation and technology investments in the public and private sectors aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This study conducted a system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) analysis to investigate how innovation and technology investments influence carbon emissions in selected OECD economies from 2000 to 2014. Using data from the OECD database and the World Development Indicators (World Bank database), it employed four proxies of innovation and technology investments, namely, renewable energy consumption, the number of researchers, spending on research and development and the number of triadic patent families. The results indicated that, after applying the dynamic model and controlling for endogeneity, renewable energy consumption and spending on research and development have a statistically significant negative relationship with carbon emissions. The number of triadic patent families illustrates a positive and significant relationship with carbon emissions, but in the case of the number of researchers, the relationship was positive but not significant. Overall, this suggests that innovation and technology investments in these countries affect emissions differently and still have the potential to reduce environmental quality. It is concluded that ensuring that patents include natural environmental standard specifications and that researchers are better equipped with green skills and knowledge would enhance the achievement of zero-emission targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

To address these challenges, the current study proposes the development of a framework that (1) harmonises the different sectoral initiatives and strategies on green skills to avoid the cyclical policy trap; (2) expands the current green Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) agenda to include green skills development for individuals in the informal TVET sector; (3) closes the coordination gap in government green initiatives by creating an agency responsible for national green agenda; and (4) creates clear qualification models and strategies for the development of green skills in the informal sector. © 2023 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.},

Nine experts in the curriculum, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Environmental Education as well as DT excellent teachers were selected through the method of purposive sampling. The data were collected using a semi-structural interview method for the first round and questionnaires for the second round. Based on the findings, two elements, namely knowledge and practice of green skills included in the GS module, are analysed using IBM SPSS version 21 to get the value of ‘Inter Quartile Range’ (IQR) and the Wilcoxon Test. The findings show that all the items for practice have been agreed upon by the experts while two items of knowledge have been rejected.

Regarding the Sustainable Development Goal 2030, the goals of the initiatives are to ensure low carbon emissions, control the greenhouse effect and generate renewable energy. The automotive industry has been identified as one of the major causes of these scenarios. Hence, this study was conducted to examine the essential green skills that need to be emphasized in the automotive industry. This study takes a mixed-method approach to obtain domains and elements of green competencies for workers in the automotive industry. The data collected using qualitative methods were analysed using the Fuzzy Delphi Method, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and NGT Modified. This study found a total of five main competencies namely: (1) Cognitive Competencies; (2) Technological Competencies; (3) Interpersonal Competencies; (4) Working Skills Competencies; and (5) Specific Competencies. It is hoped that the outcome of this study will guide the future training needs that focus on green skills.

	abstract = {There is a global effort towards transitioning to a zero or low-carbon economy due to climate change and the current energy crises. This requires a shift in socio-technical systems and cross collaboration amidst sectors. The move to a clean energy-based economy also involves the creation of a broad range of skills, the upskilling and reskilling of the existing workforce, and providing opportunities for training. While many critical analyses of emerging decarbonisation or green skills, focus on issues of clean energy transition and the distribution of opportunities between fossil fuel-based and clean energy industries, there is limited critical analysis of justice and equality regarding the distribution of opportunities for developing key green skills for place-based decarbonisation. There is evidence of asymmetric power relations and gender inequalities regarding the acquisition of skills, employment opportunities, kinds of jobs and pay gap which disproportionately affect women. This paper presents compelling evidence of hegemonic masculinisation within the energy industry; this tendency is now mirrored in ecological industries and technologies, including within the renewable energy sector, leading to an 'eco-masculinisation' of the sector. Just transition principles promote a fair distribution of resources and the representation of vulnerable groups, including women and minorities. By relying on local assets and resources, including human resources, place-based approaches to green skills could address local communities' needs while strengthening their resilience. These processes are pivotal to a fair and equitable transition. By explicitly articulating the context of place in understanding the gender(ed) dynamics of decarbonisation and skills, the authors identify and reflect on an innovative way of understanding the intersections between infrastructures, skills, and masculinisation in the transition to low zero carbon. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Conference on Gender Research.

	abstract = {Motivation: As governments move in earnest toward a green economy, few countries are considering education policy that can facilitate the development of green skills for such transitions. Where policy discussions are happening, green skills are often conflated with science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) skills, with little attention to the breadth of green skills needed to achieve climate justice. Purpose: We present a green skills framework to help support policy stakeholders imagine a continuum of green skills for a just transition. Methods and approach: This article applies a critical feminist lens to understand how green skills have been conceptualized across the gender and adolescence, greening and sustainability, and education fields. It also integrates the perspectives of stakeholders from climate, education, and gender-focused multilateral, government, and non-governmental organizations working on green skills. Findings: The analysis finds that green skills coalesce around three distinct but overlapping paradigms. The first understands green skills through a technical lens as the specific capacities needed for green jobs. The second and third paradigms understand green skills through a sociological lens, seeking to tackle the behaviours and social structures driving the climate crisis. As such, they centre on cross-cutting generic capacities and transformative capacities, respectively. Taken together, the article offers a new definition of green skills for policy stakeholders. Policy implications: The three approaches to green skills outlined in this paper constitute the pillars of a new green learning agenda for climate action, climate empowerment, and climate justice. This green learning agenda fills a significant void in both climate policy and education policy, and could help governments address current capacity building needs while setting their populations up for the long-term social transformations required to achieve a just transition. © 2022 ODI.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Although the role of human capital in the hospitality sector is critical, the industry faces challenges in attracting workers with a poor industry image frequently mentioned regarding labor shortages. This research paper attempts to investigate the factors influencing labor shortages by presenting the perspectives of employees and employers. Design/methodology/approach: Precisely 232 rural hospitality industry employees (n = 128) and employers (n = 104) in Northern Italy were surveyed using a written close-ended online survey and a quantitative research design as part of a convenience sampling approach. For hypotheses testing, Spearman's rho was used. Findings: A relationship between the shortage of professional workers and a variety of factors was found, including professional, digital, social and green skills, industry-intrinsic characteristics and symbolic image attributes of the industry. The findings show that some factors are more important for employees, while others are more significant for employers. Practical implications: This study demonstrates several practical implications for the hospitality sector by addressing the under-researched stakeholder group of existing hospitality employees, e.g. improving working conditions, reduction of manual operations through digital technologies, realistic career planning, employer branding, identification of skill deficiencies and provision of specialized trainings. Originality/value: Most research on labor shortages in the hospitality industry has focused on the perspective of either employees or employers. This study compares both perspectives, including the industry image, to gain a realistic picture of the relevant factors for a rural tourism destination in Northern Italy. © 2022, Johanna Innerhofer, Luigi Nasta and Anita Zehrer.},

	abstract = {Showing keen interest to skills and the occupation requirements of green environment, the green evolution mostly affects existing and emerging new occupations. The occupational profiles globally will change and demand for the most part new and different skills, because green skills demand already poses a major barrier to transitions to green environment, economies and green job creation. The purpose of this study was to explore essential generic green skills for green jobs in the field of electrical/electronics. A qualitative design was the main means of data collection and Nvivo was used to transcribe and analyse the data. The participants targeted for this research were (6) lecturers from the Department of Technical Education, School of Vocational and Technical Education, Adamawa State College of Education, Hong, Nigeria, lecturers from Adamawa State Polytechnic, lecturers from Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola and (6) staff of Power Holding Company of Nigeria, Northeast Zone, Gombe office, Nigeria. (3) Renewable energy Firm in Gombe, Gombe Sate. The findings of this study have revealed that the essential generic green skills are; Technical skills, renewable energy, communication skills, intellectual, core-worker relationship, and generally be physically fit. It is envisaged that this study will benefit a large number of professionals more especially those in the field of electrical engineering, green jobs and those in the green economy sector. More study needs to be carried in this area to further explore the essential generic skills. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.

	abstract = {In recent years, the manufacturing sector has been responsible for nearly 55 % of total energy consumption, inducing a major impact on the global ecosystem. Although technological advances are increasing its sustainability, zero-emission and fuel-efficient manufacturing is still considered a utopian target. Moreover, a primary feature of Industry 4.0 is the digitization of production processes, which offers the opportunity to optimize energy consumption. However, given the speed and often unpredictability with which innovation manifests itself, tools capable of measuring the impact that technology is having professions are still being designed. In light of the above, in this article we present the Worker Profiler, a software designed to map the skills currently possessed by workers, identifying misalignment with those they should ideally possess to meet the renewed demands that digital innovation and environmental preservation impose. In more detail, the authors inferred the key technologies and skills for the topic, isolating those with markedly increasing patent trends and identifying green and digital enabling skills and occupations. Thus, the software was designed and implemented at the user-interface level. The output of the self-assessment is the definition of the missing digital and green skills that enable the definition of a customized retraining strategy. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Therefore, this research study is the first attempt to empirically investigate the impact of green skills and employee green attitudes that may proffer a better explanation of the nature of the relationship between GHRM and the SDGs, proposing an inclusive re`search model on the effect of GHRM on the SDGs in the hi-tech manufacturing industry. Questionnaires were distributed to 465 textile firms; however, of those returned, only 197 surveys completed in all respects were used for further empirical investigation. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data to assess the validity and reliability of the instrument. The outcomes of the study affirmed the theoretical model according to which GHRM has a positive association with employee green attitudes, employee skills, decent work, and sustainable consumption and production behavior. Employee green attitudes and decent work had a positive effect on sustainable consumption and production behavior. It is also beneficial to identify significant moderators to explain the processes and circumstances through which the attitudes of employees are transformed into the desired behaviors. Therefore, individual green values were taken as moderators in the study to assess how they impacted the relationship between GHRM and employee green attitudes, as well as that between employee green attitudes and sustainable consumption and production behavior. The results also revealed that an employee’s green attitude acted as a partial mediator between GHRM and decent work. Moreover, employee green attitudes and employee skills fully mediated between GHRM and sustainable consumption and production behavior. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study seeks to explore the mechanisms used by manufacturing firms to promote green skills among their employees. A case study approach using semi-structured interviews was deployed to explore these mechanisms in six large chemical manufacturing firms. The results indicate that collective effort, self-realisation and continuous awareness were the three main mechanisms used by firms to promote green skills among their employees. Firms actively engage employees from every level of management together to upgrade their skills. Pay raise and promotion are used as an incentive by firms to encourage the employees to obtain green skills. This study proposes a green skills development mechanism for policy makers and managers to nurture and invigorate green skills among employees. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement: Daunting global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss may seem overwhelming. However, gardeners have a secret weapon—gardens, balconies, indoor planting, yards and allotments are mini-ecosystems that offer opportunities to counter perceptions of helplessness, inadequacy and resultant inaction by using those spaces to ‘Do what we can, with what we have, where we are’. Minimising gardening ‘footprints’ to mitigate harmful impacts, whilst maximising gardening ‘handprints’ to enhance benefits, is readily achievable. With this in mind, the Royal Horticultural Society is leading research into environmental horticulture for gardens, and benefits for individual wellbeing. Summary: This article presents an integrated and applied research approach to the unique and multi-disciplinary area of science referred to here as environmental horticulture. It does this by: (a) providing an institutional perspective (The Royal Horticultural Society) on a research approach for this particular area, emphasising why domestic and community gardens are important in the context of global environmental threats; (b) presenting four primary research focus areas and project examples; and (c) highlighting interdisciplinary linkages, future research needs, public engagement/knowledge sharing opportunities, and ‘Green Skills’ development in the area of environmental horticulture. Research focus areas discussed are: (1) responding to the changing climate (adaptation, mitigation and resilience solutions in gardens); (2) ‘plants for purpose’ (harnessing the potential of horticultural plant diversity, and gardening, to help regulate environmental conditions); (3) sustainability and climate risk reduction through effective and efficient resource management (reduction, re-use, recycling and repurposing); and (4) gardening and cultivated plant choice for human health and wellbeing. We argue that a key research priority is improving our understanding of the linkages and interactions between soil, water, plants, weather and people. These crucial linkages affect above and below ground processes, for both outdoor and indoor plants. They impact the effectiveness with which water and nutrient cycling takes place, the extent to which ecosystem services may be delivered, and the resultant capacity of gardens and gardening to provide environmental and human health benefits. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Scholars have emphasised the importance of green settings in today’s business paradigms. Studies on green behaviour have produced a plethora of noteworthy discoveries, whether focused on financial success, individual capabilities, or development. However, despite significant growth in interest in green business practices, the relationship between individuals’ willingness and green competencies has received little attention. This article used the customised green competencies conceptual model to investigate how green skills influence organisational performance and their relationship with the willingness moment. This article developed an innovative human resource management approach to address these difficulties. A questionnaire was used to perform empirical statistical research with 516 respondents from Serbian universities. Different mathematical and statistical methodologies were used to analyse the results. The findings corroborate the suggested theoretical model, and they suggest that green competencies will influence people’s willingness to participate in green activities. This article gives new information on human behaviour and organisational effectiveness in a green atmosphere. It includes managerial and practical consequences and recommendations for businesses looking to improve their social responsibility and environmental sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Climate protection is a global public good. The related mitigation policies implemented by a single country could have little effect on climate change issue such that there could be no net gains for society. However, those measures might create winners and losers among individuals. We investigate the citizens' support for different pro-climate policies in EU countries, by considering the degree of heterogeneity in their attitudes towards climate issues using a cluster analysis. We also exploit the extent to which carbon intensity and green skills requirement of jobs contribute to supporting climate policies. Our results suggest that individuals' occupational exposure does matter: people in emission-intensive activities tend to be against stringent climate measures, whereas people in jobs that require high levels of green skills are in favour of them. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

It demonstrates that a skills gap exists for business opportunities in development in a green economy. This analysis is also used to structure the skills ecosystem, which ends with four recommendations emerging from the analysis and offers a case study to support each recommendation: At the international level, there is significant concern that a skills shortage in the workforce will create challenges for private businesses and national governments responding to business opportunities and policy issues posed by a green economy.A demand-driven approach to skills doesn’t always work because employers can’t effectively articulate their needs to the skills supply authorities.The government’s new skills strategy should prioritize the skills needed to drive the economy through a low carbon transition. Authority needs to be found to spearhead the green skills program, and low-carbon skills need to be integrated throughout the skills delivery system to foster behavior change across the economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this study literature studies were conducted with documents and articles sought in electronic databases such as Academia, Elsevier, Emeraldinsight, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ScienceDirect. The findings from the results of this literature study reveal that the importance of green skills for electrical engineering is inseparable because the demand for labor in the renewable energy sector reached 10.35 million in 2017, up 5.3% from the previous year and predicted to continue to rise in the following years. The ability such as renewable energy skill and energy efficiency skill are some of the green skills that are suitable for electrical engineering students. To developing green skills, require effort such as developing a curriculum that is oriented towards environmental sustainability and with the integration of environmental sustainability content through problem-based learning. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The green economy is a priority field for developing and developed economies. However, as the authors of the publication have realised, there is no consensus about the meaning of the green economy and "green"jobs, that is why an uncertainty as in measurement of economic trends and an impact of it, as well as in what skills and competencies should be assigned to the "green"ones, arises. The new "green"processes and technologies are arising in a progressive trend, that is why it is important to ensure there are properly skilled candidates with appropriate "green"skills and competencies on the labour market, as well as to prepare fresh graduates with the "green"skills that will meet requirement of both, the recent and the future companies, especially operating in the "green"sector. In the framework of "SB Bridge"project an online survey was conducted by interviewing the "green"companies to identify which skills and competencies are needed for "green"jobs recently, and whether candidates and fresh graduates are enough with the "green"skills and competencies for fruitful engagement to "green"jobs. As the survey identified, fresh graduates and candidates for "green"jobs lack technical and (or) mechanical knowledge, IT skills, as well as experience and ability to work independently and in the team to resolve arising problems.  © 2021 Jelena Nikolajenko-Skarbalė et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Engineers equipped with skills for a sustainable built environment have never been more critical, as government and industry sustainability goals such as the 2050 net zero target have significant implications for the construction sector. Concurrently, the UK's Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) has estimated that over 250,000 new workers will be needed by 2027 to meet demand. Besides this need for green skills, the sector is also looking towards more sustainable building materials, methods, and technologies, such as homegrown biogenic offsite manufactured (bio-OSM) timber: an innovative technology requiring additional engineering and manufacturing expertise. To address this critical skills gap, the Timber Technology, Engineering, and Design (TED) Competency Framework was established by a coalition of academic and industry partners. This framework then informed the development of a hybrid training course that can prepare the next generation of timber engineers with the knowledge, transferable skills, and industry experience that can drive change towards sustainability in the built environment and inform a transformational approach in engineering education. This practice paper describes the development of the Timber TED framework and the launch of the corresponding training programme in September 2022. It also reflects on the initial implementation across two cohorts, delivered at the Centre for Advanced Timber Technology at the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering in Hereford, England, in partnership with Edinburgh Napier University and Timber Development UK. This educational initiative showcases an innovative and replicable approach to upskilling and reskilling for green skills in engineering education. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

This study undertakes a contextualised review of diverse knowledge domains to identify the key features of enterprise support for pro-environmental SMEs. In doing so, the paper plots the knowledge journey of experienced academic programme providers, from the initial design of an enterprise support programme for pro-environmental SMEs, through a thematic review of academic, grey and other related literature and finally presents a propositional and normative conceptual framework that proposes eight key features of enterprise support for pro-environmental SMEs. The resulting ‘framework for action’ aims to offer a practical tool for providers of pro-environmental enterprise support to review and improve their own provision, an analytical frame for other researchers in this field and a benchmark for SMEs seeking guidance on their pathway to net-zero business performance. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Therefore, it is urgent to identify how the industry and its employees can contribute to change towards a sustainable society. Industry leaders need to enable their employees to create sustainable solutions, using technologies rising in industry 4.0. However, nowadays there are also critical discussions about whether this trend has reached our workplace settings in a satisfactory way. Namely, there is a growing skill gap among employees in manufacturing industries causing a lack of capability to match skill needs for fast technological development and requirements on sustainability. The resulting mismatch of technical and managerial knowledge and experience will critically impact companies in competitive markets. Despite a vast range of educational initiatives available on the global market, less employees than needed are developing new skills. A smart matching process to strategically support employees in their learning paths, by matching them to new relevant skills and matching those skills to learning activities, could bridge the widespread skill gap and address challenges e.g., motivation to learn. This study reviews existing research on functional matching processes for individually tailored learning and upskilling paths for employees that need to develop skills in industry. The study's result maps out parts in a matching system and identifies the existing gap in literature. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) remains a vital tool for skilling young individuals both in and out of school. However, it appears that there has been a lack of research especially in the building construction sector with respect to green buildings in Nigeria. The main purpose of this research paper is to identify factors should be included in the greening of building construction trade curriculum of technical colleges in north western Nigeria with a view to improving teaching and learning green skills for sustainable development. In this study, simple random sampling was used to select 15 building construction teachers in the north western Nigerian technical colleges. Data for this study were collected using qualitative approach (that is interview). Respondents were requested to answer the interview questions based on the topic under study. The factors (data) identified from the perception of the respondents were collected and analysed by qualitative means based on their level of consideration with regards to improving teaching and learning green skills for sustainable development. In doing so, the data were analysed by transcription, coding, content analysis and thematic with the aid of Nvivo statistical software. Findings indicated that the three main factors that could be included in the integration of green skills into the curriculum of building construction trade include environmental, economic and social factors. Specifically, these factors were disintegrated into climate change, global warming, greenhouse gas emission, economic instability, health and safety issues related to buildings, waste and energy in buildings. This research forms the initial investigation of a more in-depth study of the green skills integration into the Nigerian education curriculum, which aims to achieving environmental, economic and social sustainability. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

	abstract = {The organisations formulate and implement green human resource management practices to achieve competitive advantage. In green human resource management literature, green competencies has evolved to a significant construct in the recent years. The state-of-the-art literature on green human resource management considers green competencies as an essential requirement for organisation to achieve environmental performance. However, literature lacks construct development and measurement validation regarding the concept of green competencies. In this regard, the study developed a Green Competencies Scale in accordance with the Natural Resource-Based View. Initially, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify the six dimensions of the construct. Subsequently, through fifteen qualitative interviews, the authors matched the literature review with the statements of the respondents and finalised a total of forty items. Later, the Q-sort procedure was conducted to refine the results. Exploratory Factor Analysis was completed to determine the factor structure of the green competencies construct, which is comprised of six dimensions and twenty nine items. After finalising the scale, the partial least square structural equation modelling tool was tested to prove the construct's precision, which reasserted its reliability and validity. To examine the nomological validity, the direct effect of green training on green competencies was examined and the relationship was affirmed. The key finding of the study is that green competencies is a reflective, multi-dimensional scale which comprises of dimensions such as green knowledge, green skills, green abilities, green attitudes, green behaviour and green awareness. The direct relationship between green training and green competencies was evaluated. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed followed by the future scope and limitations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green skills are very much needed by green industry. Nevertheless, many TVET institutions have not yet embedded green skill elements into the programme’s curriculum because it is still unclear concerning the types of green skills demanded by the green industry. Therefore, this research was conducted to identify the green skills that should be integrated into TVET curricula from the perspective of engineering lecturers in Polytechnics. The nature of this research was descriptive in which the date were collected using self-developed questionnaire. Four Polytechnics located in the East Coast, Northern, Central, and Southern of Malaysia were involved. A total of 332 engineering lecturers from three departments of engineering (Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering) were invited to participate in this research. The findings revealed that the TVET curricular should contains some of these green skills: problem solving skill related to environmental pollution, interpretative skill on environmental phenomena, research skill on environmental issues, data collection skill, analytical skill, exploitation skill on green technology, management skill on natural resources, design skill, controlling skill on environment pollution, raw material management skill, energy saving skill, recycling skill, and reuse skill. It is suggested that Polytechnics should embed these green skills into their programme curricula in order to produce graduates who are able to meet the needs of green industry. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

Preparing learners for the world of work now requires an understanding of what skills workers will need to adequately address these changes. To deal with this issue, the research community has started to define “sustainability competences” and “green skills” to support educationalists and decision-makers to better manage the impact of sustainability on future jobs. However, in the current literature, the difference between “sustainability competences” and “green skills” is not clear. The aim of this article is to highlight the differences between the two concepts in order to support the dialogue between the various disciplines that address these topics. This paper is a scoping review that provides an outline of the scientometric analyses of publications in the field of sustainability, from the earliest in 1998 up to July 2023. Although the terms are interrelated, using the R package for analysis shows that “green skills” tends to refer more to specific environmental technical skills, while “sustainability competences” are primarily defined as key competences to promote the different dimensions of sustainability, i.e., competences useful for holistic human development. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article examines the role of Vocational Education and Training (VET) in a green transition of industry. In the world of industry, battling climate change is often treated as a technical issue, but recent research on VET has tried to balance the technological paradigm with more human-centric approaches. The literature review addresses emergent VET research that presents various and partially competing perspectives on the purpose of VET in relation to climate change. Methods: We use an integrative literature review to investigate this complex topic. This technique is particularly useful for making sense of emergent research concepts, as well as various, and partially competing, theoretical and methodological approaches. It also allows us to incorporate literature from different countries and VET systems. The main search was performed in Scopus during March 2023, and included studies published within a timespan of eight years (2016–2023). Findings: Through a qualitative content analysis, we have identified five cross-cutting themes in the literature: Conceptualising ill-defined concepts of green jobs and skills; high-tech solutions in the movement towards a fourth industrial revolution versus inclusive growth for VET greening; towards sustainable work-based learning for green skills in VET; radical transformative approaches to a just green transition; and the co-creation of skill-formation ecosystems. The analysis has highlighted the ways in which VET can take on different roles in the green transition, and that these roles can be developed successively in parallel with a green transition in industry. In the development of the role of VET, it is also relevant to consider the contrast between transitional approaches and transformative approaches in VET research. While transitional approaches are recurrently marked by empirical research in specialised areas and subsystems within society, transformative approaches are characterised by a stronger focus on societal transformation (large-scale changes), power dynamics, and social justice. Conclusion: In conclusion, we suggest an analytical model that synthesises research on what role VET can play in a green transition of industry. The development model highlights that VET can take on different roles in a green transition and can gradually develop in parallel with a green transition in industry. © 2023 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

Arising from the framework of the INTRIDE European project, this article has been structured starting from an introductory analysis of the demanded skills of designers and the needs of European Union (EU) companies in the current contem-porary scenario. As such, the reflection extends to the research methodology established for the development of a state of the art on soft, digital, and green skills as a scientific basis for the definition of a cross and interdisciplinary training course entitled Strategic design for innovation in the manufacturing sector. Thus, focusing on the Bologna Declaration (June 19, 1999) in which the need to build a "Euro-pean Higher Education Area" has been declared. Based on the achieved research results, the authors propose the INTRIDE Joint Master’s Degree Program (JMDP) as a cross and interdisciplinary training course for smart designers that will become the future innovation triggers for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU manufacturing sector. This, together with added competencies related to soft, digital, and green skills – as general ones – and design and technological – as specific ones. At the end of this scientific contribution, a discussion has been reported regarding a general reflection on the developed design process and the lessons learned in the application of the design methodology, com-bined with the suggestions for a sustainable use and implementation of the proposed training program. © 2022, Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH.

The funded project involves 15 partners from 10 European countries. The very first outcome of the project is to build a competence framework for shaping the future environmental education of European citizens. The task specifically involved 13 researchers, organised into 8 teams (one for each focus area addressed by the Green Deal communication) who worked on the project for approximately 11 months (January to November 2022). The aim of the project described in this study was to establish competences, and their specificities in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes, creating a competence framework on sustainability issues and incorporating the feedback and insights of stakeholders by placing them as co-creators. From the developed competence framework, an interactive knowledge graph of competences was created as a practical tool to present and exploit the competence framework. This was then used to incorporate the bottom-up perspective and open up a discussion on research that hitherto had a top-down scientific approach only with competence elicited from literature data. In this paper the identified competences for the focus areas of Circular Economy, Clean Energy and Smart Mobility are used as case study. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the importance of innovative stakeholder contributions obtained through the Delphi study, the workshops and the assemblies with citizens of all ages, backgrounds and educational levels. The ultimate knowledge artefact consists of more than 120 competences articulated in over 2500 knowledge, skills and attitude descriptions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Nowadays, employers have started hiring workers with green skills criteria. Green skills have been in high demand since most of the industries shifted to the green industry in order to minimise the effects of greenhouse gases and protect the environment from climate change. However, some graduates from the higher learning institutions could not meet the demands from the industry due to a lack of green skills. In order to reduce the gaps, the present study attempts to reveal the elements of green skills which are highly demanded among the green industries. The qualitative approach was implemented to explore the perspectives among the participants. A set of protocol interview was used and validated as an instrument of the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among six experts from the green industries. The selection of experts for this study was based on their qualification, designation, experience, and knowledge of green practices. Data were transcribed manually, and themes were generated. A total of five elements of green skills in the dimensions of knowledge and attitude have been found specifically: 1) green technology knowledge, 2) waste management knowledge, 3) problem solving and critical thinking knowledge, 4) behaviour, and 5) awareness.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the concluding section of the book, this penultimate chapter elaborates on the central quest for research design that approaches green skills questions as inextricably linked to complex economic, environmental and social justice contexts that are systemic and emergent in nature, therefore necessitating a depth ontology and a dialectic approach, given the transformative intent of researching towards a more just and sustainable society. The chapter highlights methodological insights from the studies reviewed in this book, and provides guidance for green skills research design. It does so in relation to four interacting domains that research and programme planners need to consider in relation to each other. These are:_the political-institutional context; theory and conceptual considerations; researchers’ personal-professional commitments; and the aligned methodological considerations. The meta-theory underlabouring the work in this book is Bhaskar’s dialectical critical realism, and its practical implications are illustrated and elaborated here with reference to the most pertinent features including lamination, systems, emergence, absence and associated approaches to analysis. The result is not a blueprint for a single research design, but considerations that could give rise to a variety of different designs for green skills research. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

	abstract = {Due to the relative newness and contemporary emergence of environmental concerns and sustainable development challenges, policies and forms of work, little is known about the transitioning patterns from education to work. As environmental occupations are found in multiple sectors, and at multiple levels, it is necessary to understand how diversity of disciplinary foundation, historical factors and the nature of the field-based occupation as it is emerging influence transitions into work, especially for highly specialised occupations that are in high demand, such as wildlife vets or wetland ecologists, and in critical occupations that shape sustainable development for whole communities, such as sustainable development employees in municipalities. This chapter utilises a complex notion of learning pathways as neither completely individualistic nor wholly structurally determined, and positions our interest in transitions research within a framing of critical vocationalism that seeks to address not only individual experiences of transitioning, or individual agentive factors, but also structural dynamics and structural processes that can help to ‘ease’ the transitioning process in these critical areas of green skills development. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

The chapter starts with the argument that environment and sustainability skills are cross institutional, cross sectoral and also inter-and transdisciplinary. The chapter notes that there are a wide variety and diversity of supply side studies that can offer perspective on the many dynamics of green skills supply and provisioning. Four cases have been selected and brought into view to illuminate the influence of context and history on designing curricula and the importance of reflexive curriculum review studies, whole institution approaches and transformative, transgressive forms of learning that move beyond the boundaries of single institutions. These studies are also brought into view to indicate the scope and depth of contextual, systemic and engaged research that is required to develop transformative orientations and perspectives on green skills supply, taking skills system supply beyond the traditional training needs analysis. The chapter argues that this is an important dimension of green skills research, if conceptualised within just transitions and transformations to sustainability. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

However, the implementation of green technologies in hotels can be affected by the perspectives of managers.

Existing studies fail to draw a proper link between the factors that affect green technology use in hotels and the website content of green hotels. Semi-structured interviews of fifteen managers and topic-modeling of the website content of forty-one Indian green hotels reveal that there is a gap in communications and awareness.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the development of green skills across firms located in an institutional context, specifically the national education and skill-formation system, of the under-researched developing country of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: This paper qualitatively explores the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand. The empirical findings in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders; field visits to vocational colleges, universities, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) and firms across industries both in Bangkok and in other provinces in Thailand; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. Findings: This paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road human resource (HR) practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research concern its methodology. This research is based on the qualitative studies of the Thai education and skill-formation system and a case study of firms across industries in Thailand. Thus, this paper does not aim to generalize the findings to all other countries but to enrich the discussion on the effects of macro-level HR policies on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills across firms in each country. Additionally, it is difficult to gain access to firms across several industries and various stakeholders to understand the development of green skills among employees in these firms. The reasons are resource constraints, time constraints and the hesitation of firms in permitting the author to access the data. These difficulties have restricted the sources of information to construct a more nuanced picture of firms across various industries in developing green skills among their existing employees. Consequently, this research does not include firms in several other industries, including the pulp and paper industry, textile and garment industry, plastic industry and agri-food industry. Thus, future research may extend the topic of the development of green skills among employees to these industries. Quantitative studies using large samples of firms across industries may also be useful in deepening the understanding of this topic, which is significant from the perspectives of the strategic human resource management (SHRM), comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and green economy. Practical implications: This paper also provides practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers of firms in Thailand, other developing countries and other emerging market economies with deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system. First, the top managers and/or HR managers can apply various methods to internally develop managers and employees/workers with the appropriate environmental/green knowledge and necessary skills to perform green jobs. The methods include classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems, job shadowing and being role models for younger generations of employees. Second, these top managers and/or HR managers can cooperate with vocational colleges and/or universities in their countries to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for their firms. These managers can request for assistance from universities in their countries when their firms confront sophisticated questions/problems related to environmental/green management. In this regard, universities will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries, while firms can appropriately and accurately solve environmental/green questions/problems. Third, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their firms to apply for certificates of green-/environmentally friendly products or carbon footprint labels from NGOs to foster a green image among firms' consumers. These applications require the firms to pay special attention to the cultivation of green awareness and the development of green skills among their employees. Fourth, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their employees to express green-/environmentally friendly behaviors as well as sufficiency-based consumption behaviors. In fact, these top managers and/or HR managers can foster their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for young generations. Fifth, these top managers and/or HR managers can adopt and implement green human resource management (GHRM) practices consisting of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations in their firms to upgrade both the environmental and social performances of firms. Finally, these top managers and/or HR managers must take serious actions regarding the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices within their firms in order to facilitate the movement of the country toward the bioeconomy, circular economy, and green economy (BCG economy). Social implications: This paper provides social/policy implications for the government, vocational colleges and universities in Thailand, other developing countries and emerging market economies where the skill shortage problem is still severe. First, the government of each country should incorporate green/environmental policies into the national education policy and the long-term strategic plan of the country. Second, the government should continuously implement such national policy and strategic plan by encouraging government agencies, vocational colleges, universities, firms and NGOs to cooperate in developing and offering environmental/green management educational programs/curricula to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for those firms. Third, the government should encourage vocational colleges and universities to equip their students with green skills to be industry-ready in a real working context. Fourth, to alleviate the skill shortage problem in the labor market, the government should foster firms, especially private sector firms, to focus on the upskilling and reskilling of their existing employees. With this action, their existing employees will have green skills, be able to effectively perform green jobs and become an important driver to help the country move toward the BCG economy. Fifth, the government of each country should encourage firms to develop green-/environmentally friendly products by offering them various types of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions. Sixth, the government should encourage universities in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration. This action can ultimately facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to those university students who will finally return to work in their home country. Seventh, the government, especially the Ministry of Education, should encourage vocational colleges and universities to teach students in the environmental/green management program based on real case studies/problems found across firms. In this way, graduates should be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Finally, the government must pay serious attention to the implementation of environmental/green management policies across levels within the country so that the transition of the country toward the BCG economy will finally come true in the future. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the SHRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and the literature on the green economy and the development of green skills in firms in the following ways. First, this paper focuses on examining how the institutional context of Thailand shapes the development of green knowledge and skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In this regard, the paper aims to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should go beyond the organizational context and examine how firms adopt and implement HR practices in response to the national institutional context. Second, the paper aims to extend the literature on the green economy regarding the roles played by institutional factors in shaping the development of green knowledge and skills across firms. Finally, strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy studies have overlooked the under-researched country of Thailand. Most studies in these three areas focus more on developed countries. Thus, the findings of this paper should extend the literature on those areas regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the Thai institutional context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Environmental policy obliges modern society to transition to a low-carbon economy. After entering to life, the Paris Agreement obligated the signatories to prepare the first nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The NDCs aim first to reduce greenhouse gas emission targets under the UNFCCC and they apply equally to both developed and developing countries. Countries voluntarily indicate what actions will be taken to achieve the declared goals. The construction sector is an industry that is under scrutiny due to its negative impact on the environment, but it also has the potential to reduce it. Activities that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions can be carried out at various levels in the construction industry. One of them is the appropriate preparation of the staff, including equipping them with the so-called green skills. This research aimed to determine the competency gaps of people employed in the construction industry, including competencies in the field of low-emission economy. For the purposes of the study, a questionnaire survey was carried out in Poland and the Czech Republic and based on the results obtained the appropriate competencies were determined that should be possessed by people employed in the construction sector, including competencies related to a low-emission economy. Competency profiles for people employed in the construction sector were built and competency gaps of these people were determined. In both countries, no competencies have been identified in any of checked areas that meet or exceed the requirements of managers according to specific competency profiles. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Global warming and the increase in greenhouse gases are a current concern worldwide. The healthcare sector constitutes about 4.4% of all emissions. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, awareness and attitudes of Therapeutic Radiographers/Radiation Therapists (TR/RTTs) regarding environment-related concepts to inform the development of educational curriculum. Methods: A validated self-designed survey was distributed to TR/RTTs across Europe by the SAFE EUROPE partners and via social media between October 2021 and February 2022. The survey was divided into six sections: (i) demographics, (ii) knowledge of Circular Economy (CE) and Green Skills (GS), (iii) personal attitudes, (iv) TR/RTTs attitudes, (v) the importance of CE, and (vi) education. Questions consisted of mostly Likert scales complemented with other closed- and open-ended questions. Results: 31%–42% of participants are aware of national and departmental policies in CE and GS concepts. Even though half of the participants considered that they advocate and practice CE, the open questions indicated that participants only focus on waste management, ignoring all the other dimensions of CE in healthcare. Personal attitudes and lifestyles also did not reflect CE. TR/RTTs considered CE practices and GS development essential. However, the suggested academic level at which these skills should be developed was split between High School (44%) and Bachelor's degree (32%). Conclusion: It is essential to raise awareness among TR/RTTs about the various dimensions of CE applied to healthcare: “green transportation”, “environment-friendly procurement”, “hospital building design”, “food process optimisation”, “water reduction”, “energy efficiency”, and “waste management”. Implications for practice: These GS must be developed by TR/RTTs to decrease their impact on the environment. Their training may need to be lifelong, starting during basic high school education and continuing as healthcare professionals after graduation. © 2023},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an improved modelling approach for tessellating regular polygons in such a way that it is environmentally sustainable. In this paper, tessellation of polygons that have been innovated through the formed motifs, is an innovation from the traditional tessellations of objects and animals. The main contribution of this work is the simplification and innovating new patterns from the existing regular polygons, in which only three polygons (triangle, square and hexagon) that can freely be tessellated are used, compared to using irregular polygons or other objects. This is achieved by reducing the size of each polygon to smallest value and tessellating each of the reduced figure to the right or to left to obtain a two different designs of one unit called motif. These motifs are then combined together to form a pattern. In this innovation it is found that the proposed model is superior than tessellating ordinary regular polygon, because more designs are obtained, more colours may be obtained or introduced to give meaningful tiles or patterns. In particular Tessellations can be found in many areas of life. Art, architecture, hobbies, clothing design, including traditional wears and many other areas hold examples of tessellations found in our everyday surroundings. © BEIESP.},

Indeed, many engineers are embarrassed for asking about the effect that technology can have in effective environmental solutions because they will be perceived as less intelligent, distracted, or simply incompetent. However, those who are afraid to ask are ashamed to learn too, and when this happens the reputation of the company suffers. The main purpose of this article is to examine the effect of green skills on organizational reputation through technology assimilation and avoiding embarrassment. A conceptual model was proposed, and the article utilizes data collected through a survey instrument. The data provided by 208 SMEs based in the textile industry is analyzed using SmartPLS 3.

We find that greener and more polluting jobs are concentrated among small subsets of workers, individual workers rarely move from more pollution-intensive to greener jobs, and workers in green-intensive jobs earn on average 7% more than workers in pollution-intensive jobs. Stronger environmental policies are associated with a higher (lower) share of green-(pollution-)intensive jobs and appear to be even more effective when structural policies that incentivize greater flexibility in labor markets are operating. Taken together, the evidence suggests that with the right policies, the green transition for the labor market is manageable but will be tough for some workers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was proposed and tested. Data were collected from 208 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile industry in Valencia, Spain using a survey instrument. Partial least squares (PLS) allowed for the analysis of the data collected. Findings: The theoretical model explains 46.1% of the variation in the organisational reputation variable. The findings indicate that ethical data privacy has a beneficial effect on an organisation's reputation and eco-innovation. The findings also demonstrate how eco-innovation drives the development of new knowledge and green skills that, in turn, communicate to stakeholders a company's ethical commitment. These results should encourage SMEs to invest in data privacy in order to meet the needs of the SMEs' increasingly technology- and environment-sensitive stakeholders and to improve their reputation. Originality/value: This study provides the first empirical evidence that ethical data privacy management has a positive impact on the reputation of firms. Furthermore, the originality of the research derives from the analysis of the results from an environmental perspective. Indeed, this study shows that effective data privacy management can indirectly support organisational reputation through eco-innovation and green skills. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Human activities that harm the environment must be tackled wisely so that all efforts in maintaining a safe environment can be continued. This situation leads us to the need for preparing individuals with adequate skills and knowledge related to green skills before entering the industry. This research is conducted to identify the occupational competency profile for mechanical industry towards sustainable development. The Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was utilized in this research. The FDM is a structured investigation process aimed at reaching a consensus among a group of experts on a particular topic. Five experts were involved in the first phase and eleven experts were involved in the validation process in the second phase. The lowest items score based on the expert’s consensus were rejected. Three items were rejected because of the score less than 75 per cent. The final competency profile consisting of Skill, Knowledge, and Attitude domains with 14 sub domains was constructed. The current scenario shows that people entering the industrial world lack relevant skills to work on sustainable development. These workers are classified as low-skilled workers, which means they need to be trained before entering the labor market. This study can support the development of training towards sustainability for future workers in the mechanical industry towards sustainability. Therefore, specific training related to their professional skills, especially green skills, needs to be carried out to improve their skills. © 2023 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

This chapter sheds more light on the processes linked to the tracing of occupational networks and the occupational analysis followed therein. It shows how details regarding green skill needs were largely ‘hidden’ and we had to surface these with retroductive work across several data sources. It illustrates how in reality environmental tasks were dispersed across several jobs and form part of occupational networks. These occupational networks could be a mechanism for understanding greening tasks within work and how environmental knowledge is dispersed in workplaces. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

To explore the attitude to green skills development and the ways to embed green skills into Maritime English course, an online questionnaire survey was undertaken for students and educators of Kherson State Maritime Academy (KSMA). Maritime professionals were also interviewed concerning their experiences of green skills related to the workplace. The survey identified that in spite of their importance for the industry there is a gap between the green skills needed aboard ship and the skills actually being developed at MET institutions. The majority of maritime professionals do not consider that students always possess the relevant skills to provide safety and increase efficiency of this sector. In addition, the survey revealed that there is no clear concept of green skills. © 2022 IAMUC. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between green human resource management bundle practices and green innovation and their impact on sustainability performance as measured by the Triple Bottom Lines (i.e., environmental, social, and economic performance). It is decided to use a quantitative approach in order to collect data from 335 small- and medium-sized (SMEs) businesses operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through a customized survey. Structure equation modeling was applied through smart PLS to analyze the collected data. Results show that green human resource management bundle practices have a positive and significant impact on the sustainable performance of SMEs. Furthermore, results indicate that green innovation has a significant impact on sustainable performance and green innovation partially mediates the relationship between green human resource practices and sustainable performance of SMEs. This study demonstrates that the implementation of GI by firms can be enhanced through the use of GHRM, which, in turn, would enhance the firms’ sustainability. Additionally, this study both confirms and enhances the traditional understanding. The study also depicts that environmental management practices in the human resource and innovation sectors can result in greater sustainability.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to perform a psychometric evaluation of the internal green marketing (IGM) scale in the context of consumer, industrial and service industry from a developing economy. Drawing on IGM theory, this study validates the measurement scales to operationalize IGM as green internal communication (GIC), green skill development (GSD) and green rewards (GRs). Design/methodology/approach: The sample was drawn from the consumer, industrial and service industries in Jammu and Kashmir, India, using a random sampling method. Data were collected from consumer, industrial and service industries in two phases through a self-administrated questionnaire-based survey. In total, 137 managers responded during the first phase, and 368 managers responded during the second phase. During the first phase, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to uncover the underlying dimensions of IGM, and during the second phase, data were analyzed to test the validity of the IGM scale through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings: EFA suggested a three-dimension scale (green internal communication (GIC), green skill development (GSD), and green rewards (GR)) which was confirmed by CFA. The findings of the study demonstrate that IGM is a valid and reliable scale to capture the individual-level perception of the employees with respect to the green internal marketing of an organization. Practical implications: This paper is expected to provide valuable insights into the area of internal green marketing (IGM) about an industry that can be of immense help to domestic and international marketers in formulating human resource (HR)/marketing strategies. Further, it provides a wide-ranging scale that can act as a base for future research studies that aim to explore internal green marketing (IGM) in different organizational settings. Originality/value: IGM is embedded in three underlying elements as GIC, GSD and GRs. It is suitable to the practitioner and researchers to operationalize IGM as a second-order construct in future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This quantitative study uses a quasi-experimental technique to evaluate 62 year-five primary school students: group of treatment utilising the GS Module, and the control groups without GS Module. A GS practice rubric test was conducted to measure the performance of the students after they had practised the GS. The GS practice-questionnaires were only answered by the treatment group after using the module for nine weeks. The analysis results of the t-test show that the level of GS practice between the male and female students is almost the same and at a good level. The MANOVA's findings show that there are no significant differences of the Waste practice, 3R and water usage of green skills between male and female students. These clearly shows that the practice of the two groups are at the same level and good. Conclusion, that GS can be integrated into DT subjects, and students can implement the practices related to environmental sustainability. In addition, the GS implementation inculcates positive practices among teachers and pupils, which in turn help preserve the environment for the future generations. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

In this paper, we propose a new measure, Green Score, to capture firms’ investment in green human capital based on the concentration of green skills required in firms’ job postings. First, we find that firms that increase their Green Score have higher future profitability. Second, firms that increase their Green Score generate more green patents, and those green patents are of higher quality and receive more citations. Third, traditional ratings widely used to evaluate firms’ environmental efforts do not consider firms’ Green Score. Overall, our new action-based measure is simpler and less subjective and it offers a larger time-series variation than traditional disclosure-based environmental ratings. © 2022, The Author(s).},

There is a paradox between the top down approach to training, and the primarily regional implementation platforms of EPWP job opportunities and their developmental intent. To reconcile this paradox, I_draw on social ecosystemic skills research to probe the potential for such a conceptual and theoretical framework for guiding green skills research for the EPWP. I_share some methodologies and insights developed in EPWP green skills research projects that offer potential for providing insight into a social ecosystemic model for green skills research in EPWP programmes. Social ecosystemic models in skills research seek to develop skills development approaches that forge stronger connections between working, living and learning, foregrounding regional, place-based models for skills planning that require interfacing with vertical facilitatory mechanisms and horizontal connectivities. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

Development of this module used the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model. The contents for a green skills module were developed based on a need analysis for the elements of green skills that must be developed in vocational high schools, curriculum and a literature review analysis related to sustainability in meat processing technology. The module was designed using a scientific approach to strengthen active student learning as per the 2013 curriculum policy for vocational high schools in Indonesia. The developed module was sent to the four selected experts for validating. It gained score of 88.56% in material aspect about meat processing technology by the material experts and 89.18% in media aspects by the media experts. These scores mean that the module was categorized as very feasible. Based on the pre-test and post-test of students’ green skills with this module, the calculation of n-gain test was 0.4 which means moderate category. The findings of this study imply that the module can be used in learning to improve student's green skills.

	abstract = {Engineering plays a crucial part in responding to the biggest challenges of our era, including the transition toward a green economy by meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and by achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Engineering education could be the leading actor in preparing engineers for these complex tasks and spread the necessary green knowledge, interdisciplinary skills, and competences to pursue a sustainable future. Hungary's education system has improved significantly in the last decade, considering the Central Eastern European region. A new national higher education strategy in 2014 set new directions for its development in many aspects, including an emphasis on soft skill development in the curricula. The Hungarian higher education system was characterized for decades by memorizing facts and figures; therefore, the effective integration of soft skill development is a slow process. In our study, we first provide a systematic review of the international and national literature to identify fundamental sustainability skills and competences for engineering. We also examine the Hungarian higher education frameworks and the skill-related output requirements in the environmental engineering programs. In the second part of the research, we present a qualitative study of in-depth interviews with Hungarian experts with different academic profiles and a focus group study with environmental engineering students about their views on green skills. Our results show that the concept of green skills is slowly spreading in environmental engineering university communities in Hungary; however, the effective implementation into the curricula will require some more time and work. © 2022 SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings.

	abstract = {Purpose: The sustainable skills that informal manufacturers use in volatile times remain poorly understood. This study explored the skills that the informal manufacturers used to navigate the uncertain business environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 27 telephone interviews were conducted with informal entrepreneurs who were manufacturers of agricultural machinery at Mbare Magaba and Gaza home industry in Harare, Zimbabwe. Purposive and snow ball sampling were used to identify information rich sources. The authors used thematic analysis in identifying recurrent themes from this study. Findings: The study results show that business agility motivated most informal manufacturers to restructure their business to sustain their operations. With the closure of formal companies, the informal manufacturers adopted slowing and narrowing loops through purchasing broken down agricultural machines for repairs or remanufacturing of durable machines for their low-income customer base. Most young and formally trained manufacturers adopted a prospector strategic behaviour as they used digital platforms to network with business associates for supplies, gathering market intelligence, making and receiving electronic payments and establishing virtual distant markets whilst the older manufacturers resorted mostly to a defender strategic behaviour of engaging their usual customers for repair jobs and a few referrals. Originality/value: This study offers unique insights with respect to skills required for the sustainable and strategic management of small and medium enterprises during times of crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We argue that CCSE, as the integration of sustainability and eco-consciousness at all educational levels, should empower learners by providing competences to identify issues and responsible actions to shape a liveable planet for all. Underpinned by the CARE-KNOW-DO theoretical principles, we explore CCSE issues and provide a novel foundation for a new education movement to combine strategies, initiatives, and interventions towards learning ecologies. Findings of our Delphi Study with 27 expert academics, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policymakers of the UK Green-Forum presents seven recommendations to tackle the CCSE’s challenges: 1. Promote flexible real-context curriculum; 2. Foster cross-curricular practices with teachers’ training; 3. Establish CCSE definition with benchmarks including skills and qualifications; 4. Enhance learners’ agency through the cooperation of stakeholders and organisations; 5. Raise students’ passion for nature with a hopeful curriculum; 6. Increase green careers awareness through education, and 7. Implement tangible curriculum through policy-change with equity, diversity and inclusion. We present 60 green-initiatives and 33 green-skills for the CCSE, for empowering students to CARE-KNOW-DO actions towards a sustainable world with green-careers, green-lives, and green-societies. © 2023 by the authors.},

Many stakeholders plan and implement a daycare work program, including patients, caregivers, trainers, staff members, and professionals. The literature on daycare work programs is limited. The present study aimed to understand the impact and facilitators of a selected daycare work program (Green Skills Program [GSP]) from the lens of stakeholders. Methods: Criterion sampling was used to recruit the stakeholders who have been part of GSP. Twenty-seven stakeholders were interviewed using a researcher-prepared semi-structured interview schedule. Atlas. ti version 9 was used for coding. Thematic analysis was done to identify themes. Results: Stakeholders considered GSP easy, enjoyable, and accommodative to patients with different functioning levels. GSP participation was deemed as gainful engagement and vital to day-structuring. The patients worked in groups, which promoted peer learning and teamwork. Various behavioral, social, and work-related improvements were noted among the patients by the stakeholders. Incentives and social reinforcements were significant motivators. Stakeholders were content with the trainer's way of teaching the patients and felt that she possessed many essential attributes that motivated them and improved their work outcomes. Conclusions: While conceiving daycare work programs, ease of doing activities, accommodation of patients with varying levels of functionality, trainer's aptitude, and use of reinforcements should be considered. © 2022 Medknow.

These changes will include the creation of new green jobs and new industries, minor to major changes in existing jobs and the phase-out of some jobs in carbon-intensive activities. A just transition ensures that while working towards a more ecologically sound economy, countries also plan for positive outcomes for those communities and people negatively affected by our global efforts to decarbonise. Identifying and implementing a country-specific policy mix for a just transition is an emerging challenge for nations. This paper constructs a policy framework for supporting the greening of employment and a just transition. The resulting policy framework is then used to assess policy readiness for promoting green jobs and a just transition across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The assessment highlights the current state of policy for supporting green jobs, green skills and just transition planning, as well as the significant challenges in identifying and implementing policy settings to support green jobs and a just transition. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Investments in the green economy are used for both environmental goals and fiscal stimulus. The success of these investments depends, at least in part, on whether they create new jobs and whether such jobs are available to workers hurt by a green transition. We evaluate the employment effect of green investments from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Most job creation from green ARRA investments is permanent and emerged in the post-ARRA period, but the plausible range of estimates is extremely wide (zero to twenty-five jobs per $1 million). Such large uncertainty on aggregate effects masks substantial heterogeneity across communities. The green stimulus mostly benefited areas with a greater prevalence of preexisting green skills that created 40 percent additional jobs than average communities. New jobs are primarily manual labor and in occupations performing green tasks, especially in renewable energy. However, manual labor wages do not increase. Descriptive evidence suggests that the skill gap between green energy and fossil fuel workers is modest, but green jobs require significantly more training. Because the spatial distribution of skills and jobs matters, using green stimuli can help reshape the economy in the long run but may also exacerbate regional inequities associated with the green energy transition. © 2021, Brookings Institution Press.

	abstract = {The environmental issue was a debating topic over the past decades, but the knowledge, skill, and attitude among the people are still never changed. Several studies found that a huge contributor to waste is the industrial sector. Due to that, the green industry policies were created for environmental justice in order to minimise the greenhouse gases, and the creation of the green industries was started. The green industries were opening jobs opportunity for green jobs, and fulfilling the jobs that required someone competent with green skills. To be competent, they needed in mastering the three dimensions of green skills: knowledge, skill, and attitude. However, the skill shortage among the workers arose. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore green skills elements from the industrial perspective in skill dimension. In this study a Delphi technique were applied which started with interview session among experts. The semi-structured interview was conducted, and the protocol interview was validated through peer review and member checking. Six experts were selected from the green industries and the selection according to the characteristics such as the background qualification, job position, working experience, and knowledge in the green industry. The data was transcribed by using paper and pen, and the thematic analysis was used. From the interview session, a total of eight elements has been identified in green skills namely; waste skills, design skills, planning, procurement, and material skills, energy and water skills, communication skills, management skills, leadership and teamwork skills, problem-solving and critical thinking skills. This exploration was useful in order to conduct the next round of Delphi technique in terms of checklist items among the experts. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

	abstract = {The paper contributes to emerging scholarship on South Africa’s readiness for a green economy and growth transition, by building a case for the inclusion of skills importation during this transitional phase. The Green Economy Accord of 2010 nominated the Department of Higher Education (DHET) to be the strategic partner responsible for the provision of skills that will drive the green economy and growth transition. However, it will take some time for the DHET to achieve that responsibility, considering that it takes time to educate and train professionals. Another inconvenient truth that worsens the situation is the fact that South Africa faces severe skills shortages in a number of specialised sectors, even before one considers the growing need for specialised personnel who can operate in a green economy. The paper argues that the short term remedy for this predicament will be to look at importing green skills from other countries, as a parallel process to educating and training of South Africans. The onus will be on the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to facilitate the legal migration of such personnel. However, the DHA’s capacity to ensure the smooth registration of skilled immigrants who want to work in the country has always been troublesome. In May 2014, DHA published a new list of scarce skills, after consulting industry and other government departments. Whilst green skills are not a specific category, the focus of this paper is on assessing the readiness of South Africa’s immigration regime to accommodate immigrants with green skills and to recommend how this can be achieved. © Copyright Africa Institute of South Africa 2016.},

Part of the latter – which is supported by increasing environmental regulation – focuses on the development of a ‘green skills agenda’, which involves the ‘greening’ of existing occupations as well as meeting the skill needs of new environmental sectors and occupations. In this paper, we compare attempts to ‘green’ work and skills through an examination of engineering apprenticeships within the German and British steel industries. We argue that efforts to ‘green’ skills are taking place at varying degrees of intensity, mostly because of variations in institutional context. The evidence we present suggests that implementation of change is much more dynamic in the context of Coordinated Market Economies such as Germany, where development is shaped by robust VET frameworks and wider processes of environmental innovation. In contrast, within Liberal Market Economies such as the UK, there are significant barriers to the vision for and investments in skills generally, as well as those necessary for greening the labour process, with an extant development paradigm that is driven by short-term benefits and a limited focus on environmental compliance. © 2016, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the nature of green skills/competencies and the ways they are included in vocational and professional education in several Asian countries. It argues that the development of a green economy – one that recognises the importance of holistic integration between environment and development – is viewed by many regions and countries as a future-oriented approach; thus green skills should be considered essential competencies to be incorporated into vocational and professional education. The chapter puts forward an approach towards the classification of generic green skills/competencies and presents a model for greening formal vocational and professional education. It argues that although multiple examples of green skills’ inclusion into the curriculum – as well as some emphasis on attitude development – can be identified in the existing practices of vocational and professional education providers, there is a need to implement a holistic framework for greening vocational and professional education based on the suggested model. To achieve greening, a particular emphasis on the development of values and attitudes is required; thus sometimes narrowly interpreted competence-based training should be broadened. A reorientation of vocational and professional education programmes towards the needs of a greener economy (both current and future), would mean that individuals and societies could augment students’ general awareness of environmental issues and develop their readiness for green restructuring. Industry demand is the backbone of competence-based vocational and professional education. However, current industry practices are slowly reorienting towards greening. Therefore, a government’s participation in greening vocational and professional education is crucial. Among many actions that governments can undertake is to stimulate the demand for green skills/competencies through emphasising green innovation and its diffusion in industries. A case study from Hong Kong is presented in the chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

	abstract = {The international community has reached a consensus on developing green job vigorously, but there are still no clear theoretical definitions about green job. Through tracing international and domestic research on definition and connotation of green job, this paper regards that green job has revised and improved the traditional growth theory. Specifically, green job refers to those that have a positive effect on environment, promote energy conservation and pollution reduction, have small impact and pollutant load per unit of output, and provide decent work. This paper points out that green job has a rich connotation, and we need to understand this concept from environmental dimension, social dimension and economic dimension. In the environmental dimension, green job must be environmentally friendly, environmentally sustainable and resource-saving; in the social dimension, green job must be decent work, be able to provide protection and dignity for labors; in the economic dimension, green job must be high value-added and create gainful employment. The recognition of green job needs to be grasped from direct measurement, full life cycle measurement, marginal measurement and nature measurement. Under this analysis framework, green job can be classified to three types, which Primarily Green Job, Progressive Green Job and End of Pipe Green Job Primarily Green Job refers to those natively have positive impact on environment and promote energy conservation, such as traditional agriculture, urban afforestation, utilization of renewable energy resources and clean energy technologies. Primarily Green Job refers to those can improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emission during the production process, which covers the majority employment of manufacturing. End of Pipe Green Job refers to those can remedy environment degradation, such as waste recycling and ecological restoration. China has initially built up a framework for development of green job, but there still lacks direct incentives. In the future endeavors of developing China's green job market, the government should play a leading role, strengthen direct incentives and enhance the training on green skills.},

A study was carried out to analyse existing and potential green jobs and identify green qualifications and skills necessary for the development of the GE. The study was done within the context of the role of local governments in the adoption of green economy strategies in the wastewater treatment sector, in selected local governments across the northern provinces of South Africa. A descriptive survey method with qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed for data collection from twenty-four wastewater treatment plants in eleven local municipalities. The concept of the GE was foreign to several employees, who could not identify green jobs within most sectors of the economy. Only13.5% of the employees of the surveyed plants were involved in directly green jobs. A further 36% were in green-related jobs while the remaining 50.5% were involved in non-green jobs. Barriers to the creation of green jobs and implementation of green practices were the shortage of employees with green and conventional wastewater treatment skills, and lack of training in green skills. Several opportunities for green jobs creation exist, such as the implementation of renewable energy, r e-use of treated effluent, and processing of waste sludge into compost. To spur GE growth and create green jobs, the creation of awareness, development of skills and implementation of green technologies should be intensified. © 2018, University of Cape Town.},

The study was based on a survey of 350 real estate developers, and investors in Malaysia and the model was validated for reliability and validity. The structural equation modelling indicated that monetary green tax incentives and green skills have significant causal effects on supply. Among these factors, life cost saving motivations, government policies, green certification, developers’ expected rate of return motivations, and market strategy benefit motivations were significant. Monetary green tax incentives were, however, found to have the most significant effect on green commercial property supply and investment. © 2018},

Paradoxically, the global economic downturn offers opportunities to innovate on policies to regenerate areas experiencing deindustrialisation, with one emerging focus being the development of 'green skills' to facilitate the transition of these places to 'green economies'. In this article, we explore similar policy objectives (i.e. regeneration activity based (in part) on green economy transitions) across three deindustrialising/deindustrialised regions - Appalachia (United States), Ruhr (Germany) and the Valleys (South Wales) - to provide an account of the ways in which different regions with similar industrial pasts diverge in their approach to moving towards greener futures. Our argument is that the emphasis in such transitions should be the creation of 'decent' jobs, with new economic activity and employment initiatives embracing a 'high road' (i.e. high skill/high pay/high quality) trajectory. Utilising a 'varieties of capitalism' analysis, we contend that an effective, socially inclusive and 'high road' transition is more likely to emerge within co-ordinated market economy contexts, for example, Germany, than within the liberal market economy contexts of, for example, the United States and United Kingdom. In identifying the critical success factors leading to 'high road' green economy, the implications for any such transition within the liberal market economy context of Australia are highlighted. © The Author(s) 2013.},

This double call leads us to ask how can skills development best support development that is sustainable for individuals, communities and the planet, and which promotes social justice and poverty reduction. In considering this question, we critique the idea of green skills for the green economy as being inadequate for achieving a transformed and transformative VET that shifts the target from economic growth to the wellbeing of individuals and that enables vocational education to play a role in challenging and transforming society and work. Rather, we argue that we must see human development and sustainable development as inseparable, and plan and evaluate VET for its contribution to these. Such an approach must be grounded in a view of work, and hence skills for work, that is decent, life-enhancing, solidaristic, environmentally-sensitive and intergenerationally-aware. It must confront the reality that much current VET is complicit in preparing people for work that lacks some or all of these characteristics. It must be concerned with poverty, inequality and injustice and contribute to their eradication. It must be supportive of individuals' agency, whilst also reflecting a careful reading of the structures that too often constrain them. In doing all this it must minimise the costs and risks of any transformation for the poor and seek to lock them into better individual and communal lives, not out of them. Finally, it must transform skills, work and the world in ways that are truly sustainable of the people of today but also of those who are to inhabit the earth tomorrow. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Environmental pollution and climate change are negatively affecting the sustainability of various economical activities across the world, with Indonesia being one of them. To mitigate the environmental problems, the existing economy should be shifted to a greener economy model which will create green jobs and greening the existing occupation in the industries. Green jobs require workers with green skills. Therefore, development of green skills in TVET institutions is urgently needed. By referencing the existing green skills frame work, green skills acquisition has not been clearly integrated into the existing Indonesian TVET curriculum. However, approach to integrate green skills into TVET curriculum can be carried out through the development of hard skills and soft skills in the domain of knowledge, abilities, and attitudes where green skills is an imparting of both hard skills and soft skills. © 2017 Author(s).},

The authors of this research directed their efforts at revealing how people use “green skills” in such sectors as catering, car-service and waste management. The authors carried out sociological survey and observation in order to find out to what extent knowledge, skills, opinions, types of behaviour associated with “green skills” are spread among the respondents. Comparative analysis demonstrated that application of environment-friendly operating procedures at enterprises in official and non-official sector vary. Many employees perceive “green skills” as environmental friendliness and have no proper understanding of the role of “green skills”. © Author(s).},

The use of insulation materials made from renewable resources helps to reach environmental protection targets by reducing waste and CO2 emissions. The project Renew Building aims to accumulate knowledge about retrofit materials and techniques from renewable resources and transfer it further to a multilayer group of disciplines involved in the building process: planners, builders, craftsmen and building owners. The knowledge will be accessible in a database with free and unlimited access after revision according to practical requirements of the target groups. To successfully reach the goal of developing a cross disciplinary exchange and encouraging the use and acceptance of regional, renewable resources in the field of sustainable retrofitting, knowledge is spread via multiple pedagogical formats: on-site and e-learning training sessions for planners and craftsmen, lectures at Vienna University of Technology, via virtual platform, brochures, and by advising experts during the construction process of demonstration buildings. © 2012 IEEE.},

The problem that this study addresses is that to date research has not presented a competency framework for 21st-century job skills and green job skills for healthcare workers in the aged care industry. Therefore, the study will investigate the constructs and sub-constructs of the 21st-century job skills and green skills competency framework for elderly caregivers in the care and community services. The reason is that these skills will be needed and demand for the future human resources. The Iceberg Model by Spencer and Spencer (1993), 21st-century job skills and green job skills will be guided and presented as a conceptual framework for which this study rests.

This important mediating role is currently in high (unmet) demand in many English-speaking countries and thus more people need to be trained for this role. To determine the educational and/or training needs of a BA we conducted a survey in the Information and Communication Technology industry in Australia. The survey items are based on prior studies of information systems educational requirements and the internationally-developed Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) that has been endorsed by the Australian Computer Society. From the literature we identified three types of skills: soft, business and technical. With the increasing importance of GreenIT and the pivotal role that the BA could play in green decision making, we added a fourth type of skill: green. The survey considers 85 skills, their importance, the level of attainment of that skill, skill gaps and types of skills. Results show that all soft skills were considered to be important with the smallest knowledge gaps. Selected business skills and green skills were seen to be important. Technical skills were considered less important, but also where the largest knowledge gaps existed. Further we asked respondents whether each skill should be acquired via an undergraduate or postgraduate degree and/or industry training and experience. We found that the workplace was considered the most appropriate place to acquire and/or develop all skills, except the ability to innovate. While we found that softskills should be taught almost equally at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, business and green skills were more appropriate in a postgraduate degree. In contrast, technical skills were best acquired in an undergraduate program of study.},

To obtain a fair distribution, 27 respondents were purposely selected for the study based on their regions in Nigeria and their courses of study in UTM. The respondents were from the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of the Built Environment, the Faculty of Computing, the Faculty of Geoinformation and Real Estate, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Management. The data collected were transcribed and inductively analysed using an exploratory content analysis technique with the aid of the Nvivo statistical tool. The findings include, among other things, that Nigerians are aware of green skills and their applications, especially when related to sustainability/sustainable development. It was recommended that green skills should be integrated into Nigerian educational institutions' curriculum, with the emphasis on secondary schools. © Serials Publications.},

	abstract = {One of the strategies being advocated in response to climate change is the need to transition to a low carbon economy. Current projections show that within this transition, new jobs will be created, some eliminated and most others subjected to change. This article reports findings from interviews with a selection of twenty participants who are involved in the formation and/or deployment of green skills. The participants were asked about their perceptions of (1) how jobs are changing in the transition to a green economy (2) how are adult learners developing and using green skills, and (3) what are some of the main drivers and blockers to the development and use of green skills. The data are presented as vignettes from various positions of supply and demand within the emerging green economy. The findings of this study report that the organisations and the training providers are motivated to develop and/or deploy green jobs and green skills for a range of different reasons. These include the making of a favourable business case, environmental beliefs about conserving the finite resources of the planet and, for health and wellbeing reasons. Some blockers that have been identified are the initial capital outlay for any changes, and the need to address some inconsistencies that arise over time in the financial arrangements when trying to work out the business case. This has led the designers and contractors working in renewable energy to call for a level playing field with those who provide and utilise finite resources and non-renewable energy. Overall transition to a low carbon and green economy is shown to be supported and occurring with some limited success. However there is a need for further larger scale research into this area of skill formation and deployment. © 2015, ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC. All Rights reserved.},

This article aimed at finding out the major green skills demanded by the green industry based on the existing literature. In the present study, document analysis was employed. The published articles and technical reports related to green skills in various disciplines were identified from electronic databases that includes ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and Academia. The findings from literature review revealed that there are ten most common green skills demanded by various industrial sectors, namely, design skill, leadership skill, management skill, energy skill, city planning skill, landscaping skill, communication skill, waste management skill, procurement skill, and financial skill. The role and directions of skill training institutions should be aligned with the needs and wants of the industrial sectors. Therefore, it is imperative for the skill training institutions to revise and revamp their curriculum in order to produce graduates with green skills to cater for the demand of manpower market. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Supporting green skills development is integral in the transition to a green economy. Green skills can be difficult to define and measure at an aggregate level because they are a socially constructed concept, intangible and are often unobservable. Further, a demand-led approach to green skills has not worked because employers are unable to effectively articulate their needs to skills delivery bodies. This advances the need for a transformative methodology that is able to provide a more nuanced view of skills planning to support green work. Drawing on transition theorists, this chapter demonstrates that greening work transitions occur in “niches” at local levels, where nexus concerns arise around the impetus to green work. Furthermore, it is from these transformative niches that wider social changes and regime shifts are driven or emerge. Using experiences from the chemicals sector in South Africa, the chapter illustrates the need to develop non-reductionist conceptualisations that illustrate the “regime lock-ins” as well as green skills opportunities at multiple levels. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Najma Mohamed.},

The chapter first provides a meta-reflection on the different types of green skills research that are needed to, in combination, make a stronger impact on the national system of skills research and planning. Secondly, the chapter makes a strong argument for aligning green skills research to the Sustainable Development Goals, and their critical and contextual articulation at national level, with emphasis on working with the cross-cutting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, Target 4.7 that motivates for governments to include a focus on education and sustainable development across the lifelong learning system in order to enable and support learning and skills for enabling the other SDGs to be realised in practice. Lastly, the chapter considers the shift in the way that work is considered when political economy meets political ecology, and we argue that work transforms towards not only a productive focus, or a social focus, but also an ontologically grounded regenerative focus, much needed at the start of the twenty-first century. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz-Sisitka.},

The experiment method in order to make a better appearance or an attractive shape and to have more nutrition. In addition, the pie was filled with a mixture of sweet and sour gurame as Indonesian traditional food. By applying an organoleptic test to 10 respondents, the result shows that pie dough recipe using flour substituted by baked-smashed sweet potato with 2:1 of a ratio. Coloring pie dough adding extract vegetables (carrots, beets and celery) as color. We found that pie dough has more interesting pie color (90%) and the texture of the pie with a quite level of crispness (60%). Moreover, the pie taste is fairly (70%) and tasty (70%). Nutritional analysis results show that per size, serving guramnis rainbow pie contains energy as much as 81.72 calories, carbohydrates 12.5 grams, fat 2.32 grams and 2.77 grams of protein. The main findings are the pie appearance and taste was different compared to the previous pies because of the pie was served with gurame asam manis as the filling and had flour and cilembu sweet potato as the basic ingredients. The color of guramnis rainbow pie was resulted not only from food coloring but also from vegetables extract namely carrot (orange), bit (red), and salary (green). Thus, it had many benefits for health and adds the nutrition.

The combination of these three studies contributes to an improved understanding of what these young adults think and are learning with regard to skills for sustainability in their VET courses and in their workplaces.

	abstract = {Workers who have green skills can also be considered sustainable human capital. In fact, the process to produce sustainable human capital is closely linked to the curriculum implemented in institutions that offer training for occupations. Polytechnic Malaysia is one of the big institutions in Malaysia that offer Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET). Focus area 1 (BT1), action plan 5 (PT5) of the Blueprint Polygreen document clearly refers to the lack of green elements in the Polytechnic Malaysia curriculum. Blueprint Polygreen also states the urgent need to implement green practices by incorporating green elements across the curriculum by up to 30%. In response to this, this study was conducted to explore green elements for greening the existing curriculum at Polytechnic Malaysia. The study was conducted using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). The FDM analysis shows elements of integrity get first ranking in the inventory of green elements in this study. These findings also indicate that the element of integrity is a very important element and should be incorporated in the Polytechnic Malaysia curriculum to enrich students' learning in order to produce sustainable human capital for the nation's needs. © 2017 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {Promoting green technology to protect the environment is a major challenge in the current world. Human activity that affects the environment must be designed with a proper manner to ensure that the effort to maintain good practices is achieved. Referring to the above matter, an individual that entering the industry must be equipped with adequate skill and knowledge related to green skills. However, the scenario shows those individuals that enter the labor market without a relevant qualification is common in Malaysia. In the labor market, these individuals are considered to be low-skilled workers because they had no training prior to employment. Therefore, specific training needs to be prepared for them to increase their skills. Therefore, this research is conducted to develop a job competency for these groups of workers pertinent to its aim towards sustainable development. This research provided an opportunity to examine an enterprise-based approach to skill formation for workers with basic academic qualifications. Curriculum Development Based on Ability Structure (CUDBAS) methodology is used for this research where a structured curriculum development of human resources learning needs will be designed according to the job profile of the typical individual and group work. It will provide a clearer perspective on knowledge, competence and skill levels of employee behavior in performing tasks. The biggest impact on this study is to produce high skill employees concerning customer satisfaction and increased organizational productivity towards high-income nations. © 2019 Int.

	abstract = {In advanced economies the ‘greening’ of the economy is widely seen as promising extensive job creation and upskilling, alongside its other benefits. In popular and policy rhetoric, the growing importance of ‘green skills’ is asserted frequently. This study critically examines these claims within the context of the electronic waste management sector in the United Kingdom. Drawing on the cases of a non-profit organisation and a small private enterprise in North West England, we observe that despite government support for developing skills in e-waste, both the development and utilisation of skills remain minimal. Critically, the relatively more skill-intensive process of reuse is substantially less profitable than recycling and resource capture. The study concludes by noting that the expectations from the green economy for high-quality jobs need to be assessed within the context of similar, misplaced celebrations of previous transformations of work to avoid recycling the same promises. © 2016 The Authors.

The study presents the perceptions and understandings of participants drawn from four different cohorts. These cohorts are: (1) key players in the community/industry representatives; (2) TAFE managers; (3) TAFE teachers; and (4) TAFE students. The study found that work and jobs are changing to become more sustainable though investment in large scale alternative energy generation while often lauded had failed to reach fruition. Likewise, VET training programs are also changing with teachers and students contributing to the complex arrangements around the supply and demand for green skills. The teachers at this regional TAFE who participated in the study reported that they were well supported in accessing and participating in relevant sustainability-related professional development. Finally, numerous examples were evident throughout the study of how the work performed by staff at this TAFE institute was contributing towards regional and community development. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.},

The motivational components and attributes were found to be in favor of Malaysia. The Wilks' lambda F-test and the standardized discriminant function coefficients, showed that there were significant differences between developers in both countries as assessed by the life-cycle cost motivations, green policies and certification, market strategy, developers expected rate of return, green tax incentive, and available green skills. However, the variables with the most predictive power in accounting for the differences were found to be within the measures of life-cycle, cost-saving motivations.

Several experiments were carried out to produce a pie dough crust mixed with baked-smashed sweet potato and added with vegetables extract as the food coloring. The experiment method in order to make a better appearance or an attractive shape and to have more nutrition. In addition, the pie was filled with a mixture of sweet and sour gurame as Indonesian traditional food. By applying an organoleptic test to 10 respondents, the result shows that pie dough recipe using flour substituted by baked-smashed sweet potato with 2:1 of a ratio. Coloring pie dough adding extract vegetables (carrots, beets and celery) as color. We found that pie dough has more interesting pie color (90%) and the texture of the pie with a quite level of crispness (60%). Moreover, the pie taste is fairly (70%) and tasty (70%). Nutritional analysis results show that per size, serving guramnis rainbow pie contains energy as much as 81.72 calories, carbohydrates 12.5 grams, fat 2.32 grams and 2.77 grams of protein. The main findings are the pie appearance and taste was different compared to the previous pies because of the pie was served with gurame asam manis as the filling and had flour and cilembu sweet potato as the basic ingredients. The color of guramnis rainbow pie was resulted not only from food coloring but also from vegetables extract namely carrot (orange), bit (red), and salary (green). Thus, it had many benefits for health and adds the nutrition. The researchers recommend a further study in order to make pie dough with baked sweet potato and vegetables extract having an optimal level of crispness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The data set of 100 projects allows for evaluation by both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thus the projects are evaluated on their innovation contribution but also on their scalability going forward. Implications for the resources needed to ensure such projects continue to be developed across the globe are discussed; and the green skills needed to ensure their success. The projects cover a range of applications including Buildings, Food, Energy, Transportation but also Resource and Education sectors. The Circular Economy concept is used to identify commonalities between the projects. And key challenges in the development and deployment of the solutions are highlighted. The key research question is: What strategic policy support is needed within HEIs to ensure the development of the necessary multi collaborative and cross disciplinary mind-sets and skills that such projects require. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {The power sector is one of the greatest beneficiaries of private investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and project financing structures globally. South Africa has adopted a unique approach to renewable energy (RE) project finance and partnership development. This unique approach is referred to as the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). The programme is implemented through Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects. The aim of this article is to assess IPPs as a variant model of PPPs. To this end, the first objective is to determine what type of partnership IPPs constitute. The second objective is to gain an understanding of how a variant PPP model can be structured. This research is based on a qualitative research design. Data from past research studies, comprising 66 interviews and 168 interviews respectively, were triangulated with current research, including 13 interviews and a conceptual and documentary analysis. The findings of the research suggest that IPPs contribute to diversifying the country's energy mix; developing RE technology; infrastructure, local economic, and green skills development; and stimulating socio-economic development. This research is unique as the concept of hybridity or hybrid PPPs is an unexplored area in public sector management. Hybrid PPPs represent a unique approach to public-private procurement for energy partnerships. The hybrid PPP model serves public interest and is crucial to the country's energy transition. © The Social Sciences Research Society.},

	abstract = {The construction industry is contributing to the sustainability agenda through numerous strategies to improve energy efficiency in the design, materials, and operating conditions of buildings. However, this is only one driver of change in the construction sector. This article, which takes Australia as a case study, shows that many other drivers are also important. Among them are the growing importance of building information management systems, and the trend towards the factory manufacturing of components and onsite assembly in construction. Rather than see these as competing drivers of green construction, the article argues that the emphasis on soft skills in these drivers can be used, within the training context, to reinforce the sustainability and green skills agenda. © 2014 UNESCO IBE.},

	abstract = {In the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, green building practices are migrating from cutting-edge to becoming the "new normal." The transition from conventional practices to green practices in homebuilding requires firms to acquire new skills and knowledge to meet market demand. While many of the skills required to offer 'green' building services are similar to existing skill sets in the AEC industry, the additional complexity causes a significant degree of uncertainty among homebuilding industry professionals AND educational stakeholders.As part of a U.S. Department of Labor green jobs training grant targeted toward regional energy-efficiency building services, the authors developed a research model for better understanding the needs of green building training in Southwest Virginia. The research team chose to assess green jobs through the experiences of those on the front line of these practices, employers and employees of firms in the homebuilding industry, including those in the offering of green services. The information acquired through this process illuminates several issues with existing education and training programs that influence green building practices, and the impact of these issues on providing effective green skills training to workers in the construction industry. The goal of an improved training system for green building occupations is to create an educational system that could substantially mitigate many of these perceived risks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {One of the requirements of building a learning city is working to ensure its sustainable development. In 2014, UNESCO developed a framework of the key features of learning cities, at the centre of which there are six pillars or ‘‘building blocks’’ which support sustainable development. This article focuses on the third of these pillars, ‘‘effective learning for and in the workplace’’. The author analyses a number of conditions to address this aspect in the context of ‘‘green restructuring’’ which is geared towards facilitating the sustainable development of learning cities. She argues that, at the conceptual level, an understanding of the nature of ‘‘green skills’’ (what they are) and the reasons for ‘‘green skills gaps’’ (why they exist) are essential for the processes of effective learning and strategy planning in sustainable city development. The specific focus of this article is at the policy level: the conceptualisation of partnerships between technical and vocational education and training (TVET) providers, industry, government and other stakeholders with the aim of fostering the production, dissemination and usage of knowledge for the purpose of sustainable economic development and the ‘‘greening’’ of skills. The author proposes a new model, based on the quintuple helix approach to innovation combined with a policy goals orientation framework to theorise the ways in which learning cities can foster sustainable economic growth through green skills development. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning 2018.},

We conduct econometric analyses of European Small Medium Enterprise firms to assess the factors affecting the creation of green jobs in small and medium firms. We find that green product and service innovation is primarily relevant to the creation of green jobs. The interaction term between an environmental management system and product and service innovations has a positive and significant effect on the decision to hire for green jobs. We also conduct a deep analysis of the subset of firms that produce green products and services, which reveals some idiosyncratic features. This study lays the foundations for future research on the development of green skills, competences and jobs in firms as a reaction to market and policy levers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the association between occupational clusters and allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: The study was based on data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES: 2007-2015). This study included 46,965 individuals: 20,491 men and 26,474 women. AR was defined as having been diagnosed by a physician. Occupations were classified according to occupational characteristics and skill levels into white (chief executives, senior officials, legislators, managers, professionals, and technicians), pink (clerks, clerical support workers, services and sales workers), blue (craft and related trades workers, drivers, plant and machine operators, assemblers, elementary occupation workers), and green (skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers) categories. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of AR according to the occupational clusters by using the chi-squared test and logistic regression. Results: In the study population, 10.7% of the men and 13.5% of the women had AR. The prevalence of AR was highest among white-collar workers, followed by pink, blue, and green-collar workers. Compared to green-collar workers, among men the adjusted ORs of the blue, pink, and white-collar workers were 2.00 (95% CI 1.58-2.53), 2.46 (95% CI 1.91-3.15), and 2.78 ( 95% CI 2.20-3.51 ), respectively ; and among women were 2.45 (95% CI 1.99-3.02), 2.64 (95% CI 2.15-3.25), and 3.63 (95% CI 2.96-4.47), respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that AR prevalence is significantly associated with occupational clusters. © 2018 Japan Society for Occupational Health.},
